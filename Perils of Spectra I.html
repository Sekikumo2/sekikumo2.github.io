Groggily, you tell it to give you five more minutes.  As the captain, you are afforded certain privileges, after all.

Unfortunately, the chime refuses to cease.  It would appear one of your passengers still remembers their command codes, and has decided the captain has to wake up at a reasonable time.  Revissa, her arms around your waist, her face nuzzled in the crook between your neck and shoulder, makes an annoyed grunt.  You know her well enough to understand that if you don’t make that sound go away soon, there’s going to be a problem.

What do you do?

[[Ignore it.  It’ll go away on its own eventually -&gt; P01A]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name=" P01A" tags="" position="16,120" size="100,100">Screw it.  You’re the captain, and you’ll sleep as long as you want to.  No damn alarm is going to tell you what to do!  You fold your ears as flat against your head as you can and pull Revissa in closer, determined to cuddle away the morning without interruptions.

Revissa, unfortunately, is not having it.  There is a sudden rush of movement as your wife shapeshifts into a grizzly bear and pounces at the comm panel, destroying it with a combination of teeth and claws and a quarter-ton of raw physical force.  She growls proudly at her handiwork before shifting back to her normal appearance, though, sadly, the display was jarring enough to shake away the last dregs of drowsiness from your body, leaving you with little recourse but to get out of bed and actually do your job.

[[Check yourself out in the mirror -&gt; P02]]

(set: $foamed to false)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name=" P01B" tags="" position="16,239" size="100,100">As captain of this ship, you’re not going to let anyone override your capacity to turn on the snooze alarm.  There will be consequences for this brazen defiance of your authority!  But for the moment, you just want to get more sleep.

Gently removing your arm from your gorgeous wife’s waist, you sleepily flail about on the table next to your bed to find your blaster pistol.  Obviously, firing it within crew quarters would show a blatant disregard for any and all safety regulations.  But wouldn’t it also be unsafe to force the captain to report for duty when she was still drowsy?  

Unfortunately, when you finally get your hands around the blaster, your clumsy fingers accidentally depress the trigger, causing a beam of concentrated energy to emit from the muzzle of the weapon and ricochet wildly around the room (you obviously didn’t leave the safety on - who would have time to disengage it if you were raided by pirates in your sleep and needed to defend yourself in a hurry?)  

In the end, the blast just harmlessly dissipates against the ceiling, but not before somehow triggering the automated fire suppression systems.  Thus you and Revissas are rudely awakened by a dousing of cooling foam, forcing you both out of bed as you shiver wildly.  On the bright side, as soon as your feet touch the floor, the comm system registers you as being awake, and the alarm helpfully stops.

At this point, further attempts to sleep are pointless, leaving you with little recourse but to get out of bed and actually do your job.

[[Check yourself out in the mirror -&gt; P02]]

(set: $foamed to true)
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name=" P01C" tags="" position="16,355" size="100,100">Though it’s been a while since you’ve had crew aboard other than your darling wife, you vaguely recall the feeling of wanting to impress the people under your command.  And so, with the deepest regret imaginable, you extricate yourself from Revissa’s warm and loving embrace and slide out of bed.

On the bright side, as soon as your feet touch the floor, the comm system registers you as being awake, and the alarm helpfully stops.  On the darker side (though this is open to interpretation), Revissa is none too pleased that you have shirked your responsibility to spend the morning cuddling with her, and immediately shapeshifts into a giant spider.

With the threat properly contained, she transforms back to her normal self and spends the next half hour making the case for why you should never have crawled out of bed.  It is *quite* convincing.

Sadly, all good things must eventually come to an end, and when the alarm blares a second time even she must acquiesce that duty must be performed.  She cuts you free, helps wipe off any sticky residue leftover from her bindings, and permits you to get started with your day.  At least you’re not tired anymore!

You rub your eyes, yawn loudly, scratch your butt, then trundle over to one of the walls of your quarters, waving a hand to activate a holo-screen which displays a mirrored image of everything facing it.  Checking out your reflection, you have to admit - you’ve still got it.

Your name is Melfy Murachi.  You’re the captain of the Lucky Break, and the Commander of the Rabbit’s Foot Company, a mercenary outfit you inherited after a run of bad luck took out all the former members.  You’re 5 foot 10 - about average height for a kemomi, with short blonde hair and fur that turns brown at the tips of your ears and tail.  A daily workout regimen ensures a muscular physique, even if in recent years you haven’t had as much occasion to make use of it.  You’d like to think it’s your bright blue eyes and winning smile that makes you irresistible to the ladies, but honestly it’s probably just this rockin&#39; bod.

Though by no means famous, you and your crew made a name for yourself during the war between the Kemomi Empire and the Elvaan Federation.  Some might even generously say your heroics turned the tides - maybe even saved the galaxy!  Not that the details ever became fully public.  Either way, after the war died down, most of your crew went their separate ways.  A lot of the enlisted support crew you were ‘borrowing’ either went back to their old positions in the military or returned to civilian life.  Krysta and Lumina settled down together on Mine Nine, eager to start a family.  And Vhaja made good on a promise to officially begin pursuing a career in the Empire navy.  Despite being an Elvaan, you hear she’s proven herself capable enough that there are whispers she’ll have her own starship command within a year or two!

Which is kind of why you’re out here in the first place.  A week ago, Vhaja got in touch, asking for your help to conduct some field research that has to be kept under wraps for political reasons.  Eager for some action, you readily agreed - even if you still don’t know exactly what the mission entails.

You watch a pair of hands encircle your waist in the reflection on the wall as Revissa slides in against you.  She gently kisses you on the shoulder, moving in such a way that shows off the adorable twitches of the little deer tail poking out from her pert behind.

You first met her when you were just starting out your adventuring career.  She was a part of the Bolg resistance, trying to repel the Orochebi occupation of their homeworld.  You bumped into her just as some Orochebi soldiers were trying to arrest her.  You’d like to say you valiantly rescued her, but instead you were also immediately captured after trying to step in.  Luckily, the rest of your crew at the time tracked you down and got you both free a day later, so technically it was your actions that led to her escape.

What followed was a steamy love affair, strong enough that you were considering joining the resistance together with her.  But she knew better than to get you tied up into it, and disappeared into the night, vanishing from your life until several years later, when *she* helped save *you* from some kidnappers.  At that point, the occupation was long over, and she was happy to join your mercenary company and rekindle your romance, though she was stationed on a different ship.  After the war when the company mostly disbanded, she stayed on, officially tying the knot with you.

Once she has your attention, she lounges alluringly, showing off her body for you to appreciate.

She’s about the same height as you, though with a less defined physique.  Her long brown hair comes down into a tight braid draped over her back, and her fair skin is covered in beautiful green ritual tattoos that denote her as a mistress of druidic Bolg magic.  That said, half her blood is Elvaan, which is why there are only two tiny horns poking out from her forehead rather than the full antlers most of her people would sport - though she still has the adorable deer-like ears and tail, brown like her hair though spattered with spotty patches of white.

She’s talented in various forms of nature magic, able to make plants grow, manipulate the earth and soil, create healing herbs, and even conjure animals to come to her aid.  Though perhaps her most noteworthy ability is the capacity to shapeshift into animal (or animal hybrid) form, letting her be anything from a bird to a bug to a fish to even a T-rex, when the situation calls for it.  You’ve always been particularly fond of her ‘deer-taur’ form, which allows you to hop on her back and ride her - in more ways than one.

With a smile, you pull her in close and go for a passionate good-morning kiss, one which she readily accepts.]

[[Get dressed and head to the bridge -&gt;P03A]]
]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name=" P04" tags="" position="363,10" size="100,100">Your ship is called the Lucky Break, a modified cargo vessel with space to fit about twenty crew comfortably, though it&#39;s been ages since you’ve even approached that number.  For years it was in such disrepair that visitors were always worried life support would fail at any time, or that a hatch would blow somewhere and you’d all be thrown into the endless vacuum of space.  After the war, you finally got around to having some of those critical systems repaired, enough that while it’s still a piece of junk, at least everything important works, more or less.

As you and Revissa enter the bridge, you find yourselves greeted by a number of familiar faces.  Vhaja is the first to stand and speak to you.

(if: $bearsmash is true)[“Ah, Captain.  So good of you to finally grace us with your presence.  I’m glad to see that in the years since we’ve worked together, you’ve become the sort of person to destroy a comm panel rather than reporting for duty at a reasonable time.”

“That was me, actually,” Revissa says proudly.  “Your alarm ruined our morning.”

“My deepest apologies,” Vhaja replies, with her usual amount of dry snark.  “Next time I drop a lucrative military contract into your lap, I’ll be sure to not actually hold you to completing it.”](if: $foamed is true)[“Ah, Captain.  So good of you to finally grace us with your presence.  And you only caused a single fire in the process.” 

“Oh, don’t worry,” you say with ironic confidence.  “There wasn’t any fire.  I was just trying to shoot the comm panel making that damn alarm and missed by a few meters.”

“Of course.  I’m so glad after dropping a lucrative military contract right into your lap, you would rather destroy part of your own ship than show up on time to complete it.”](if: $bedwebbed is true)[&quot;Ah, Captain.  So good of you to join us.  I suppose a blaring alarm wasn’t quite enough to convince you to roll out of bed.”

You scratch your head sheepishly.  “Actually… I was really trying to report for duty on time.  I just, uh, got a bit tied up along the way.”

Revissa smirks and pinches your butt playfully.  Your tail gently wags as you think about how much fun it was being all wrapped up by her.

Vhaja, ever the vigilant one, picks up on your body language and groans.  “My apologies.  I thought perhaps dropping a lucrative military contract right into your lap was reason enough for you to put your… libidos on hold for just a day, but I suppose I was overestimating your restraint.”

“Oh, no, she was definitely restrained,” Revissa says snidely.  That gets an eyebrow raise from Vhaja, and an embarrassed blush from yourself.]

You hold up your arms diplomatically.  “Look, let’s just put all that aside, and maybe you can finally tell us what this mission is about?”

Vhaja sighs in the way she always does, looking you over with an expression as if she is having regrets about contracting you in the first place.

She was one of the founding members of the current iteration of your mercenary outfit, the Rabbit’s Foot Company.  Surprisingly fit for her species, her trim figure is accentuated with dark brown skin, piercing green eyes, and light lavender hair tied into a pair of signature braids hanging over her shoulder.  As an Elvaan with a rare case of morals, she betrayed her own race by trading military secrets she had access to for Kemomi Empire citizenship.  And when the war ended, she decided to stay on working for the empire navy.  Currently she is serving as a science officer on a mid-sized starship, but she is quickly climbing the ranks to eventually get her own command.  

“I’ve hired you for the purposes of a… simple research mission,” she says slowly.  “You are to head down to a particular planet and place some data-gathering equipment in predetermined locations.”

You raise a skeptical eyebrow.  “No way you’d call me in for something ‘simple’.  Let me guess - this planet is off limits?  The kind of place an official empire science vessel couldn’t be seen near?”

“You are, as always, savvy in your insights.  Yes.  The planet in question has been designated as restricted by inter-planetary treaty.  And yet… the insights it might provide through study are too fascinating to turn down.  For the specifics, I will defer to my partner to explain better than I can.”

Jyumon Zathura, scion of a well-to-do family in the empire, and recently appointed chairwoman of the Kemomi Science Consulate.  Though she is an expert in all things both academic and arcane, her chief speciality is in ghosts, spirits, and the supernatural - phenomena which she herself classifies as falling under the field of ‘spookology’.

But obviously, the thing that stands out most about her is her appearance.  Perfect curves, a beautiful, bushy tail, and long, luscious reddish-brown hair that is always held up in a high ponytail that swishes whenever she moves.  And unlike you and Revissa, she and Vhaja seem to be able to maintain an aura of professionalism when in each other’s presence.  

“To put it simply, the planet we are heading to is incredibly spooky,” she says.

You scratch your head.  “Okay, I rarely say this, but could you maybe put it a little bit less simply?”

The gorgeous fox makes a polite chuckle.  “Less simply, the planet - currently designated as Spectra I - is a ghost.  By which I mean, it should be dead, and yet is not.  According to cosmological scans, several centuries ago its sun released a radiation wave that destroyed all life in the system - including on Spectra.  Yet, somehow, the planet continued to live regardless.  Everything there is, technically, a ghost, but is carrying on pretending that it isn’t.  To the naked eye, it would look like a perfectly normal planet, capable of supporting life - though currently without any sapient species.  However, check it on the thaumaturgical spectrum and it is positively teeming with ectoplasmic matter.”

You’re not sure you understood the less simple explanation, but you nod your head anyway.

“So… why do you need us?”

“The planet is technically in the neutral zone between Kemomi and Elvaan space.  This system was specifically selected as a buffer because, at the time of the treaty, there were no habitable planets there.  But this ghost planet just… showed up a few months ago.  Appeared out of thin air, as far as we can tell.  And we’d like to have a look at it.”

“Can’t you just send down drones or probes?”

“Impossible.  Because it’s a ghost planet, nothing without a soul can physically interact with it.  So what we need is for you to set up some of these data collection devices in a specific formation about ten miles apart from each other, to triangulate readings.  The data collectors are powered by living insects and complex bio-gel circuits, which should be sufficient to allow them to keep operating.”

“Alright… seems simple enough.  Head down, plant the probes, and leave.  So, why did we bring in her?” you ask, pointing to the other face in the room.

Your old friend smiles and comes in for a hug.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name=" P06" tags="" position="600,0" size="100,100">You grew up an orphan on a small colony run by the Kemomi military.  And ever since you could walk, Krysta had always been there with you.  Your own last name, Murachi, was the name of the colony, given to you since no one even knew who your parents were.  Krysta used to have that name too, making you practically sisters, until she eventually learned she was a part of the infamous McKendricks clan.

Though she is technically half-kemomi, those genes ended up being recessive, meaning she normally has no fur or tail (though a small bout of unrelated lycanthropy means she occasionally transforms into a squirrel girl).  Her other half is Yearthling, a strange race of physically unassuming women with plain, rounded ears, and no other distinguishing features.  Krysta and her wife, Lumina, a winged Celestial outcast from her society, were together with you and Vhaja the founding members of the current Rabbit’s Foot Company.  Now she works as a Star Scout, part of an organization of magical girls who protect the galaxy.  She is on permanent assignment to Mine Nine, a hollowed-out asteroid made into a space station that orbits a wormhole that connects two distant parts of the galaxy.  An important transit hub, which she does her best to keep safe - a far cry from her early days as a petty thief.

“Bring it in!” she says, wrapping her arms tightly around your waist.  Always much stronger than her, you hug her back, tight enough to make her gasp for breath and frantically tap out.

“It’s great to see you.  Both of you,” you say, glancing over at her beautiful wife.  

Lumina smiles and clasps your hand affectionately.  Long black hair, gorgeously feathered wings, and an impressive bust - it’s not hard to see what Krysta sees in her.  Though her best feature is her nurturing personality.  It’s no surprise she would start a family once the war ended.

“How’s the egg?  Hatched yet?” you ask.  How the two of them ended up being the proud parents of a dragon egg is too complicated a question to get into at the moment.

“We’re still waiting, sadly.  Melyra is egg-sitting for the week while we’re away.” Lumina says.  “Though really, you should come see that for yourself.  You don’t visit nearly enough!”

You raise your hands apologetically.  “Sorry… but you know how it is.  Busy living the adventuring life and all–”

“We haven’t had a job in three months,” Revissa chimes in ‘helpfully’.  

That makes you cough awkwardly.  “Anyway!  What about this job requires your, uh, expertise?”

“Knotties,” Krysta says simply.

“...Knotties?”

“Yup.  Apparently they’ve set up camp and have been scavenging the place for resources.  It would seem that restraints made from ghost matter are really excellent at keeping prisoners, uh, ‘fresh’, if you get my meaning.”

The Knottie race, as you well know, is almost entirely dedicated to the art of bondage.  To them the act of restraint is as natural as breathing.  Through various mystical techniques, they can even submit people to a state of ‘permanent bondage’, where the subject no longer needs to eat or drink, and doesn’t even age.  Normally that technique is only available to incredibly talented martial artists, but if you follow what Krysta is saying, tools made from ghost matter can allow anyone to put people into ‘permanent bondage’.  You can see why they’d want the stuff.

“As something of a bondage expert myself, and being well-trained in their techniques, I’m gonna head down to their camp together with Lumi to do some negotiating.  They’re not bound - heh - by the treaty, so if we could pay them under the table to occasionally send us some samples, that would be great.”

Vhaja steps forward.

“So, to summarize.  You and Revissa will plant the probes, Krysta and Lumina will negotiate, and Jyumon and I will remain on the ship in orbit to monitor your progress.  Is that clear?”

You would object to her acting like she’s the captain - but the money on offer for the job really is quite generous.

“Oh, in that case, why don’t we reminisce about old times?” Lumina suggests brightly.  “It’s been so long since all of us were together!”

“An excellent idea,” Vhaja says.

You were totally going to suggest that!  That’s what you get for trying to be a good captain.  You resolve to never do it again.

“Hey, is it true you installed a holo-simulator?” Krysta asks.

“Actually, yes,” you say.  “How we got the money for it is actually a really cool story.  I had to –”

“Last one there is a rotten clucker egg!” she says loudly, running at full tilt off the bridge.

“How generous of you.  But I’m gonna hold you to that.  Before we get started, why don’t we all take the opportunity to catch up on old times?”

“Oh, that sounds lovely!” Lumina says, clapping her hands excitedly.

“Agreed,” says Vhaja.  “We have at least half a day of travel before we reach the neutral zone, so we have plenty of time for it.”

A chance to relax, and put off doing work until the last possible minute?  Now this is more like it!  You feel like things have gone back to how they were in the old days.

“Hey, is it true you installed a holo-simulator?” Krysta asks.

Some are equipped with powerful AI processors that can generate entire movie plots on the fly.  Others are little more than glorified film projectors.  The one on the Lucky Break is somewhere between those two, but leaning much closer to the less-advanced end of that spectrum.

Krysta is the first one inside, and is unsuccessfully fiddling with the controls as you enter.  Unlike Vhaja, she doesn’t remember her command codes from when she was an official crew member.  As everyone else files in, you come up beside her and unlock it.

“What program should we run?” she asks, as she begins scrolling through the options.  It is only at this point that you realize why that’s a problem.  “We’ve got… Spider Queen Bondage Dungeon, Virgian Slave Market… oooh, Knottie Sex Cult!”

You get her in a headlock and drag her away from the controls.  Everyone else laughs as your face turns a bright shade of red.

“The Spider Queen one is her favorite,” Revissa says helpfully.

“We know,” say Vhaja and Lumina in unison.  Have your fetishes always been that obvious?  You cough loudly and scroll to the options at the very bottom - the only two that aren’t just purely porn programs.

The ground turns from mute gunmetal to cobbled stones, a water-filled pit manifests in the center of the room (or, more accurately, holographic matter is formed to raise your feet into the air so that there is now space to sink ‘lower’), drinks appear on charming little trays, fluffy towels show up neatly folded to the sides, and a small hedge of modesty bushes sprout up around a path that would lead farther into the ‘resort’.

All of it, of course, is fake, and given the bargain bin parts the chamber has installed, a lot of it doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.  The bushes, for instance, have patches of oddly yellowed leaves in places, whose pattern is identical to the stains on the wall.  But it’s good enough.

Vhaja raises an eyebrow.  “This is the least pornographic program you could muster?”

“And here I thought I wasn’t going to wind up naked on this mission,” Jyumon says with a beleaguered pout.

Revissa has already doffed her clothing, and slides into the water without a care.  “Don’t be shy!  On Bolg, it’s very traditional to meet old acquaintances in the nude, so you can see for yourselves how your bodies have changed since you were away.”

There is some huffing and puffing, but eventually everyone acquiesces.  And after the first hour, no one much seems to mind.  Holographic resort staff bring out tray after tray of holographic snacks, and despite none of it being ‘real,’ the chamber is still programmed to simulate things such as taste - and the effect of alcohol.

It is, honestly, some of the most fun you’ve had in years.  You feel a smile creep on your face that doesn’t let up the whole time you’re there.  Well, at least until the discussion comes back around to the mission.  Though maybe you’re not quite ready to talk business…

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name=" P09" tags="" position="200,250" size="100,100">You press the button, and watch as the formerly featureless holo-chamber (save for the cracks in the floor and water stains on the wall) transforms into a digitally imagined scene.  The ground turns from mute gunmetal to coarse, rough sand that gets everywhere, the walls seem to vanish, giving way to an endless expanse of cerulean blue ocean, and the gentle background hum of normal starship mechanisms is replaced with the lapping of waves and the cawing of distant gulls.  

All of it, of course, is fake, and given the bargain bin parts the chamber has installed, a lot of it doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.   The sky, for example, would be perfectly convincing - if not for the various discolored splotches in the same shape as the water stains on the wall.

You turn to your friends.  “Alright everybody.  Now get your clothes off and the program will manifest you some holographic swimwear.”

Vhaja raises an eyebrow.  “This is the least pornographic program you could muster?”

“And here I thought I wasn’t going to need to get naked on this mission,” Jyumon says with a beleaguered pout.

But everyone eventually complies.  And when they’re done, the program (much to your own surprise) actually works as intended, providing your crew with setting-appropriate attire.

After striking a pose with the group, Krysta runs off to inspect the volleyball net resting in the sand off to the side.  She turns to you and smirks.

“Whaddya say?  Up for a match… ‘captain’?”

You raise an eyebrow.  “I may be a bit out of practice, but I’ve still got a leg up on you when it comes to sports.”

“Yeah?  Well we’ll see about that!” says the red-head.  “Wanna make a bet?  Loser has to do whatever the winner tells them to!”

“You’re on,” you say, fully confident in your future victory.

Revissa, perhaps slightly turned on by the alpha wolf behavior, sidles up next to you and presses herself against your arm.  “This is a team game though, isn’t it?  Obviously, I’ll be your partner.”

Krysta scratches her head.  “Good point.  I guess I need one too.”

You look towards the rest group.

“Of course!  It’s been so long since we’ve played any games like this!” she says, doing some stretches - and losing her balance in the process.  

As she face-plants into the sand, you give Revissa a confident look.  Krysta might be passable at athletics, but Lumina is a hopeless klutz.  You’ve got this one in the bag.

“So, what exactly are we playing for?” Revissa asks.

“Hmm… how about the losing team needs to play maid service for the winners?” Krysta suggests.  “Serve drinks and snacks and stuff for the rest of the time in the program.”

Everyone agrees to those terms.  And so the game begins.

It goes almost exactly like you expected it would.  Krysta is passable at the sport, but you’re strongest, faster, and have kept yourself in better shape than she has.  And while Revissa isn’t the most capable when she isn’t using magic, compared to Lumina it’s like night and day.  After the third time the angel gets hopelessly tangled in the volleyball net the holo-program glitches out and is unable to regenerate it, ending the game by default, with a final score of 14 - 2 in Team Melfy’s favor.

“Well, how do I look?”

…well, a body like hers was custom-built for fetish cosplay.  She was always the motherly sort who enjoyed cooking, cleaning, and things like that, so in the end it’s hardly a punishment at all.

Still, everything was in good fun, with laughs and smiles had by all as Krysta scampers back and forth fulfilling people’s orders.  You and Revissa spend the rest of the time sitting beside each other, hand in hand, watching the waves and reminiscing on old times with your friends.  The time goes by much too quickly, and before long you are forced to get back to business and discuss the specifics of your mission.

“I was actually hoping you would ask,” she says with her trademark quiet confidence.

Krysta scratches her head.  “Oh… I was kind of expecting that Lumi was going to be my partner.”

“A good choice… if you did not want to maximize your chances of winning,” says the Elvaan.

You raise a finger.  “Hey, so, just a point of order, but this is just a normal game, okay?  No magic allowed or anything.”

“Of course,” says Vhaja.  “I would expect nothing less.”

A shiver runs down your spine.  You had been confident in your choice… but now, you somehow feel like you made a mistake.  And as the game begins, you understand why.  Vhaja had always kept herself fit, of course, but you had never taken her for being particularly athletic.  But when the first ball she returns spikes you directly in the face, you are reminded that a few years can make all the difference in the world.

As the game goes on, Jyumon and Lumina cheer from the sidelines, and the points quickly rack up for both sides - with the advantage going to the other team.  Vhaja proves to be far more adept than you ever could have imagined, and soon the only way you can keep up is by intentionally trying to serve on Krysta’s end of the field and hoping she slips up enough to win.  

She doesn’t.

When the last ball hits the sand, the score is 17 to 21 in Team Krysta’s favor.  You lost.

After the girlfriends charge the field to give the winners a hug, Krysta turns to you with a big smile on her face.

“Now… what should we ask of the losers?”

Vhaja gets a strange look in her eye.  “Krysta, perhaps you could lend me some of your ropes…?”

Wait… since when had Vhaja been into bondage?

A few minutes later, you and Revissa are bound and gagged and crunched into the trunk of a dune buggy.

“Consider this practice for the mission,” Vhaja says, as she slams the trunk shut.  “Any Knotties you encounter on the planet will tie far better knots than this.”

And so, for the next few hours, while the other two couples enjoy the sand and sea, you and Revissa wriggle and squirm.  By the time you finally escape, you’ve nearly reached your destination, and you are forced to get out and discuss the finer details of the mission.

“Why in the world would you ask *me* first?” she wonders aloud.  “I am utterly hopeless when it comes to sports, and - no offense - but I could not ever imagine myself teaming up with Krysta to begin with.”

“Absolutely none taken,” Krysta replies.  “And obviously, she was just so desperate to win that she was trying to pick the absolutely worst possible choice to be my partner.”

Jyumon grimaces.  “Actually, that does slightly offend me.”

“Look, I’m just spitting truth here,” Krysta continues.  “If this were a video game, you’d have put all your stat points into floof and boobs and nothing into anything useful in the real world.”

“You know, I am actually quite offended, now,”  Jyumon says.  And, with a quiet wave of her finger, she weaves a small curse around the red-head.

“Offended or not, we still need a victim to trounce!” says Revissa.

She’s right, of course.  You look at your options.

The holo-chamber was fun, but in the end, business has to win out over pleasure.  As the simulated environment fades away, everyone puts their original clothes back on, and congregates in the center of the area.  Vhaja inserts a data chip into the computer to bring up a holographic map of Spectra I, then has it zoom in on a particular continent.

“So, to get straight to the point, we need you to land on the planet and place data probes in three predetermined locations.  The probes will triangulate their detection radius and should be able to create an etheric sensor net that will penetrate to the core of the planet.”

You nod blankly, already somewhat lost.  At least everything is clearly labeled.  With the landing site at the center of the map, it looks like you’ll need to venture through three distinct locales - the ruins of an ancient city, a subterranean cavern, and a section simply labeled the ‘spider forest’.  Why is it every planet seems to have a forest (or jungle, or desert, or mountain) filled with spiders?  You’d like to have a word with the creator of the universe about it.

The mission is otherwise simple enough to understand.  Vhaja drones on and on, but really the gist is to just reach the three locations without being caught by the local wildlife.  Or the environment.  Or the Knotties.  Okay, so maybe it won’t exactly be easy, but you’re confident you can pull it off.

“Something to keep in mind is that everything on the planet is comprised of what Jyumon has dubbed ‘ghost matter’ - elements that technically shouldn’t exist in the physical world but which, nonetheless, are in absolute abundance here.  Such matter interacts with sentient beings in unpredictable ways, but most important for our purposes is the fact that it can preserve living creatures entangled with it indefinitely.”

You nod your head.  “So if we, say, were gobbled up by a giant plant, or were wrapped up in spider webs, or even just got buried under a rockslide, we wouldn’t be in any mortal danger.”

“Exactly.  Though you might not be able to escape, you’ll also not suffer from hunger or thirst, you won’t age - you won’t even need to *breathe*, technically.”

“But if no one manages to find us… then we’d also basically be stuck forever.”

“Let’s hope it does not come to that.  Luckily, we all have some tools which should help you.  Let’s go over each of them.”

Everyone agrees to those terms.  And so the game begins.

You thought it would be easy.  But there was something you didn’t account for.  Jyumon, in her annoyance, put a minor curse of incompetence on Krysta - one to make her trip, stumble, botch her serves, and overall be just as big of a klutz as Lumina was.  But therein lay the problem.  For as soon as the game starts, the power of two people with a comical level of ineptitude somehow cancels each other out, causing all their pratfalls to somehow, consistently, land the ball on your side of the court.  Before you know it, you’re on the ropes.  Which is when you get stabbed in the back by the woman you trusted most.

“I resign from the team!” Revissa yells, right when Team Krysta is one point away from victory.

“Wait… what?” you say, as Krysta steps on a pointy seashell, yowls in pain, falls over, and somehow in her flailing manages to connect with the ball and send it smacking right into your face.  

And so… against all odds, you’ve lost.  But Revissa’s betrayal stings more than the pain of defeat.

“I… can’t believe I have to do this alone…” you grumble, trying to hide the burning sensation in your cheeks.  You’d rather be paraded around naked than be dressed like… this.

Revissa just grins and raises a hand to order.  

“I’ll take a chestnut tea, extra syrup!” she says brightly.

And so the humiliation begins.  Everyone is so amused by your predicament that you have no time to really enjoy the scenery, forced to run back and forth delivering drinks.  For once in your life, you are actually relieved when it comes time to discuss the finer details of your mission, since it means you can finally take a break.

However, as the game goes on, the influence of Jyumon’s curse makes itself apparent.  Krysta keeps missing returns, colliding with her partner, or just plain tripping over her own feet.  It would normally be enough to make the game a cakewalk, but even with her teammate more hindrance than help, Vhaja puts on a good show.  Just… not quite good enough.  Perhaps Jyumon should have thought twice about weaving a curse before knowing who the recipient’s teammate was going to be - but you’re not complaining.

When the last ball hits the sand, the score is 21 to 17 in Team Melfy’s favor.  You won!

After giving your girlfriend a great big victory hug, she turns towards the losers with a surprisingly vicious smile on her face.

“Now then… what to do with these two?”

Vhaja and Krysta back away nervously, but Revissa only smiles as she makes some druidic hand motions which are all too familiar to you.  And then in a flash, she has taken the form of a giant spider.  The rest of the scene basically writes itself.

Once the two of them have been divested of their beachwear, Revissa spins them some silky new duds… though perhaps the outfits are a bit too tight.  Either way, the tethers over their lips prevents them from complaining. Once her work is finished, she leaves it to Jyumon and Lumina to decide the fate of their captive lovers.

As they squirm, you can’t help but be a little jealous. (if: $bedwebbed is true)

There’s just something about spider silk that always gets you going.  Maybe it’s the fact that, no matter how strong you are, and no matter how much you struggle, the webbing will never break.  It’s stronger than steel, after all.  Being totally at the mercy of a woman you love is nice too, of course, and so you wiggle happily as you submit yourself to her care.

What you were not expecting was the surprised squeak from Lumina, as she clumsily slipped into some of the leftover strands while playing with her girlfriend.  And then, somehow, managed to completely restrain herself while trying to get free.]

That, somehow, makes it hotter.  Though at least Revissa is nice enough to eventually squish Krysta against Lumina (who both quite enjoy it), and Vhaja to Jyumon (who also enjoy it… but are annoyed that they do).  

If only you could have this much fun every day.  Wait… you do, because this amazing woman is you wife, and she is only too happy to satisfy your fantasies.  Well… all the ones that are possible to satisfy.  To be honest, even more than your lovely wife, you still dream about being kidnapped for real by a sexy spider lady of some kind, wrapped up tight and forced to submit to all her wildest desires…

Ahem.  Anyway, you still feel pretty fulfilled by the end of this kinky beach party.  Eventually, Revissa cuts you free, and you, in turn, rescue the others.  And though quite a few feathers are ruffled (or in Lumina’s case, gunked up with silk residue), you eventually smooth things over enough that everyone is ready to get back to work discussing the finer details of your mission.

And so, when Revissa draws near to have some fun with you, you play along… for a time.  But when the opportunity presents itself, you distract her with some heavy moans, then start guiding her to step backwards into some stray silken strands to get herself stuck.  Not enough to really incapacitate her… but she can see the devious gleam in your eyes.  And, bless her heart, she’s always willing to indulge you.  

So she conjures some more webbing with her own nature magic, and starts to wiggle herself into it, spinning this way and that until her arms are stuck at her side and her lips are firmly sealed.

Eventually, one such ship detects you.  And, when no one responds to the hails they send, the Kemomi officers on the patrol ship naturally board your vessel, and find all of you helplessly writhing in the holo-chamber.  While there’s no harm done, the incident does get entered into the patrol ship’s log… which in turn directly places all of you, and your ship, at the scene, right outside restricted space.

In the end, this forces Vhaja to abort the mission.  Your horniness has completely ruined all their plans, failing the job before you even stepped foot on the planet!

Though the holo-chamber can generate food and drink, and even simulate things such as taste and texture, in the end none of it is ‘real’, and by the time you exit any sense of fullness from eating or any side effects of what you consumed will be gone.  Which means… you could all drink as much as you want with no ill effects afterwards.

So why not a drinking challenge?  You’ll square off and see who can take the most alcohol.  Losers are determined when the holo-chamber’s internal safeties kick in and decide the drink is making them sick - at which point the loser will be disqualified via a paralysis field being activated around their bodies.  What the winners want to do with them while they’re frozen is totally up to them.

Discussion breaks out over the finer points of the rules, but eventually everyone agrees to it in the spirit of good fun.  It is decided the game will be held in two rounds - first everyone pairs off to out-drink a single opponent, and then the remaining three players will have a free-for-all to be the last woman standing.  As the person who suggested the challenge, you take it upon yourself to choose who your first rival will be…

[[Challenge Revissa -&gt; P08B]]
[[Challenge Krysta -&gt; P08C]]
[[Challenge Lumina -&gt; P08D]]

You would shiver, if you could move a muscle.  “So I’ve built up something of a tolerance… and also learned to be more forward.  Forceful, even.  Kemomi respond better to confidence than quiet logic, I have found.”

And then with a slight smile, she leans in and gives you a soft kiss on your glossy cheek, before pulling away to give more… intimate attention to her girlfriend.

“Oooh, is there some lingering sexual tension in the air?” Revissa says, her voice slurring slightly.  

Vhaja’s cheeks color ever so faintly.  “Perhaps there is…” she admits.

“Well, don’t let me stop you from acting on it!” Revissa says… as she quickly downs another drink before the game even starts.

The two of you stare each other down.  Is there some lingering attraction?  Yeah… probably.  When Vhaja first joined the crew you had shared a brief fling, but both of you had moved on since then.  But perhaps…

“Well, captain, shall we begin?”

Vhaja slides a drink in front of you, before picking up her own.  It looks like the time for reminiscing is over.]

“We have… something of an agreement.  One that permits us to act on our… physical urges with other partners.   I imagine you and Revissa have a similar arrangement.  So… allow me to… show you how much I appreciate your friendship.

And show you she does.  Her fingers (and, eventually, tongue) dance along your body, finding every hidden crevasse, every zone of pleasure.  If you weren’t frozen in place, you would moan in ecstasy, but all you can do is receive her ministrations with mute composure.

“Here I thought Melfy was going to be the winner.  You deserve a prize for dethroning her.”

[[Oops -&gt; P08Y]]
]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name=" P08Y" tags="" position="400,675" size="100,100">Hours go by as the six of you stand still as statues, helplessly held in place by the holo-chamber’s procedurally generated paralysis pads.  None of you can move an inch, able to do nothing but stare ahead and ponder the mistakes that led to this outcome.  Since the drunkenness you’re experiencing is simulated, none of you will sober up naturally, which also means there is no way to automatically trigger the safety protocols to release you.  All you can do is stand and wait, light gleaming off your glossy skin.

And while you do, the ship moves forward, heading towards your destination.  Since it was a restricted area, you were supposed to turn on some jamming devices to prevent patrol ships from noticing your approach.  But with everyone paralyzed, that never happens.

Eventually, one such ship detects you.  And, when no one responds to the hails, the Kemomi officers on the patrol ship naturally board your vessel, and find all of you helplessly trapped in the holo-chamber.  And while there’s no harm done, the incident does get entered into the patrol ship’s log… which in turn directly places all of you, and your ship, at the scene, right outside restricted space.

In the end, this forces Vhaja to abort the mission.  Your crew’s carelessness has completely ruined all their plans, failing the job before you even stepped foot on the planet!  At the very least, you get points for efficiency.  Unfortunately, the failure will jeopardize your friend’s career, and almost assuredly means there will be no more military jobs coming your way in the future.

|drink2)[Which brings things down to the final two.  You honestly can’t believe the slim Elvaan could be so good at packing away alcohol, but as the empty cups pile up, you start to realize that she’s finally reaching her limit.

“What a shame… I thought I had finally surpassed you,” she says, quietly setting down her final cup.

You raise an eyebrow.  “I didn’t realize you were trying to.”

Vhaja smiles warmly.  “To be honest… I had always looked up to you, Melfy.  Your confidence.  Self-assurance.  Even when you were hopelessly outmatched, when you were woefully unqualified to handle the situation.  Over your head.”

“Um… I think I’m supposed to be flattered?” you murmur.  Is she being serious right now?  Or is it just the sake talking?

The Elvaan answers that all on her home.  With strangely eager eyes, she leans forward, kissing you deeply on the lips.

“Trying to rise through the ranks in the empire military means spending a lot of time in back rooms sharing drinks with the brass,” she explains, slowly drawing away.  “So I’ve built up something of a tolerance… and also learned to be more forward.  Forceful, even.  Kemomi respond better to confidence than quiet logic, I have found.”

“I don’t… wha?” you sputter.  “You and Jyumon are still together, aren’t you?”

“We are.  And I love her completely.  It was actually she who picked up on it… my lingering emotions.  My attraction to you - both emotional and physical.  We have an agreement, the two of us, that permits us to seek out pleasure in other arms, when the inclination takes us.  I originally had no plans on pursuing it with you, of course… but I suppose losing to you has brought all those feelings to the forefront once more.”

And so she stands up, posing herself calmly on the paralysis pad.  It starts to glow, as arresting light washes over her.

“Enjoy your prize… Captain.”]

A deep blush covers your cheeks - and not just from the alcohol.  You had no idea Vhaja had felt this way about you.  Sure, you’d hooked up once, right when she first joined the crew, but that was at a time the two of you were emotionally vulnerable.  That there was still something there…

Well, if she opened up this much, it would be rude of you not to reciprocate.  She said Jyumon was okay with it… and you know Revissa would be too.  And so… you take your prize.  Or maybe it’s her who really won?  Your fingers, your lips - and on a few occasions, your teeth - find purchase on her frozen body.  She is stiff yet still soft and warm, and unresisting to your advances as you pull off, you hope, some of your best moves.  And though there is no outward indication of her pleasure, certain autonomous functions of her body provide you a clue as to her enjoyment.

 And so, for the next two hours, the losers are at your mercy, though only one of them has your attention.  Until, eventually, you instruct the holo-emitters to set everyone free. After all, you weren’t really getting drunk, the program was just making assumptions about the state of your body based on its parameters.

“These are nano-fiber synthesizers and molecular recombiners.  Able to generate clothing, tools, and basic equipment within seconds.  I’ve already taken the liberty of programming them based on your outfits and weapons compliment.”

You nod your head in thanks.  “That’ll help.  Funny how the perils on alien planets always seem to destroy your clothing, isn’t it?”

“You call it ‘funny’, I call it ‘infuriating’.  I had to go on a mission in a spider-filled jungle once, and got stripped naked more times than I can count.  Which is why I never leave home without at least a few dozen of these, just in case.”

After slipping them into your pocket, Lumina walks up to you next.

“I’ve spent the last few weeks imbuing these stones with Celestial healing magic,” she explains.  “Hold it up to your body and it will cure you of most wounds… and revert any unwanted transformations.”

You nod and accept the handful of beautifully glowing diamonds - every single one sparkles as if a star were trapped within its prism.  These will be useful.  Perhaps the only thing more common than spiders on your adventures are things that want to petrify, gild, vitrify, encase, solidify, harden, congeal, or otherwise immobilize you.

The angel gives you a warm, but worried smile.  “But don’t get too careless - if both of you get transformed at the same time there won’t be anyone around to restore you.  Based on Vhaja’s analysis, it doesn’t look like anything on the planet will be able to petrify you permanently… but that doesn’t do you much good if no one can find your statues…”

“Which is where I come in!” says Krysta.  

She hops forward and hands to you what looks like a small, individually wrapped hard candy.

“This is a Star Scout Tracking Gumdrop,” she explains.  “Cherry flavor, of course.  Once you eat it, you’ll give off a magical aura that is detectable on most Star Scout comm frequencies.  If you feel particularly imperiled, it will basically send out a distress beacon that can be used to track you down for a rescue.”

You palm it quickly.  “Not that I’ll need it, of course.”

“Hey, you never know,” your friend says with a shrug.  “Just make sure you finish the whole thing, or it won’t work.”

Finally, Vhaja approaches you, bearing two small packages wrapped in cloth.

“And these are from me.”

You take one and uncover it, revealing what appears to be a small, rune-covered dagger.

“If you find yourself thoroughly restrained with materials made out of ghost matter, your raw strength probably isn’t going to be much help in getting you free - but this is enchanted to allow you to sever even spectral substances.  Without this, getting captured probably means you’d be staying that way until someone else arrives to rescue you.  So… try not to have both of you get restrained at the same time.”

“No promises,” you say with a smirk.  “Because the only thing hotter than being bound and gagged and at the mercy of a sexy evil lady is having your wife bound up right beside you.”

Vhaja gives Revissa a stern look.  “Please do not indulge her fetishes while on an important mission.”

Your wife snickers and gives you a quick peck on the cheek.  “You have my word - if she tries to surrender herself to a sexy villain, I’ll make sure to tie her up first instead.”

“How… reassuring,” the Elvaan mutters.

But with that, it appears all the details have been thoroughly explained.  And a helpful chime from the ship’s computer tells you that you’re nearing the restricted area of space around the planet.  It looks like it’s time to finally get this mission underway!

[[Head to the bridge -&gt; P12]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name=" P12" tags="" position="925,300" size="100,100">As soon as you arrive at the bridge, you instruct the ship’s computer to activate a signal jammer to make sure no nearby ships notice your approach.  The entire reason for bringing you in on this mission is to avoid the diplomatic incident that would arise if a Kemomi ship breached the Neutral Zone, so you don’t wanna anyone to know you’re here - even the local Kemomi patrols.  Once that is done, you bring the Lucky Break out of its hyper-jump, leaving you about twenty minutes of sub-light flight away from your destination.

Vhaja makes a motion for you to draw near.

“Now then, for the most important part of the mission.  Please take these data synthesizers.  They are specially made to gather information from Spectra I.”

A strange device that seems to be comprised of concentric rectangular frames with a brightly colored sphere in the center begins to hover above her hand.

“And they are also one of a kind,” says Jyumon.  “Or at least, three-of-a-kind.  And quite sensitive.&quot; 

(link:&quot;Accept the synthesizer&quot;)[(show:?drink1)]

“It has bio-gel circuitry, and is powered by tiny, living insects which inhabit the inner frames.  Each segment has a different scanning function, and must be set up within a triangulated distance from one another, about a mile apart.”

You carefully take the object from her hands and slip it into your bag.

Vhaja looks at you sternly.  “Please do not lose it, drop it, or delay too long in setting it up.  Once properly aligned, the segments will attune to the planet’s thaumic field, but if it runs out of battery before then it will be rendered inert.”

“So basically, if we get incapacitated for too long, the mission’s a bust,” you observe.

“Exactly.  Please distribute the pieces at the proper locations as quickly as possible, and we will perform remote calibrations from orbit on the ship.  However, transmission signals must otherwise be kept to an absolute minimum, both because we are not supposed to be here in the first place, but also because they will impact the synthesizer’s calibration settings.  The only messages you should send are for each time you reach one of the destinations and set up the device to let us know to begin searching for its data stream.  Once you’re finished, rendezvous with Krysta and Lumina at the Knottie camp, then head back to the landing site for extraction.”

You nod in understanding. “Got it.  So, maintain radio silence except after each successful installation.”  

At this point, you feel like you’ve gone over everything you needed to.  You and Revissa just go over your equipment (and maybe do a bit of light canoodling), until you hear Krysta call out from in front of the helm.

“Hey, looks like the planet is coming into view!”
(set: $picP28 to true)

[[Check it out -&gt; P13]]
]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name=" P13" tags="" position="925,425" size="100,100">Spectra I looks like - well, a planet.  Green landmasses, blue oceans, a perfectly breathable atmosphere.  Not that different from Fuwafuwa Prime, or any other habitable, life-supporting world.

“So… what’s the big deal?” says Krysta, saying aloud what you were thinking.  “Looks pretty boring to me.”

Jyumon begins fiddling with the viewscreen controls.  “Well, for one thing, the ectoplasmic discharge that builds up in the stratosphere creates a perpetual aurora borealis.  At any time of year, any time of day, in any part of the continent, not localized to any particular region.”

“Can I see it?” Revissa asks.

“Yes, of course.”  

And with a press of a button, a display of the sky above the landing sight sends shivers down your spine as a kaleidoscopic array of fantastic colors swirls in a constant celestial tango.  The display becomes only more vibrant as the ship breaches the planet’s atmosphere, quickly passing through clouds as it descends to the designated landing coordinates.  From this high up, the trek to the three targets doesn’t look like it will be that bad at all, but you know from experience how dicey missions can get in the blink of an eye.

To your relief, the Lucky Break’s landing struts properly deploy without any additional coaxing, despite not having been serviced since before the end of the war.  And they hold their weight as the ship touches ground, giving nothing more than a few protesting creaks as the engines power down.

[[Disembark -&gt; P14]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name=" P14" tags="" position="925,550" size="100,100">The Lucky Break’s exit is via the loading ramp in the cargo bay, and, like always, the bay doors get stuck as they try to roll down, forcing you to take time to manually pull the emergency override lever to get it moving.  Someday you’ll get it properly repaired.  Probably.

As soon as the ramp lowers, you are struck by a whiff of some of the freshest air you’ve ever breathed, and a dazzling light show twisting in the sky above you.  To the west is a thriving, verdant forest, to the east are the ruins of long-gone civilization, and south are towering cliffs that nearly reach the aurora.  For a supposedly dead planet, it certainly feels more alive than most industrialized worlds you’ve visited.  Though, when you pay closer attention, you do get a sense of… wrongness to the place.  You can’t really put a finger on why, because nothing your eyes, ears, or even nose tells you seems incorrect, yet the fur on the end of your tail still stands on end.

*Fwump!*

Speaking of fur, your oldest friend suddenly sprouts some as she takes in the view.

You still don’t quite understand the process by which it happened - some kind of ancient magic that ‘unlocks true potential’ or something, but whatever the reason, Krysta now suffers from a ‘curse’ that randomly changes her from Yearthling to Squira.  You always knew she was half Kemomi, but it seems the curse activated her recessive genes - and this was the result.  While poofy-tailed she is faster and more nimble, and is able to scamper up trees and steep inclines, but is also more skittish and excitable, racing away at the slightest provocation.

“Oooh… look at all those high branches!” she yells, eyes darting to the west.  She starts to high-tail it over there, but a chiding voice from above calls her back before she gets too far.]

Though it’s been a few years, Lumina’s heavenly curves haven’t diminished an inch.  If she’s gotten rounder since then, it’s been in all the right places.  Her wings flutter behind her as she takes to the air, catching Krysta by the scruff and pulling her in the proper direction.

“*Our* job is to be diplomats - remember?”

“Right!  Bondage!” Krysta says, her big, poofy tail swaying wildly behind her.  You’re totally not jealous of how much floofier she is than you when she’s like this.  Nope.  Not at all.  

She scampers back towards you and smiles.

“Alright, time for us to head out!  You can find us with all the sexy tentacle-head ladies - just listen for the sound of ropes and leather,” she says with a smirk.

For you, bondage is a fun way to pass the time with a girlfriend (or a sexy villain).  For Krysta - and for Knotties - it’s a way of life.  An art form.  You have every confidence she’ll be able to win them over with her skills.

And then she’s off in the proper direction.  Lumina waves one last time, before soaring after her in the air.  Though, before she gets out of sight, Krysta turns and calls out to you.

“Make sure to eat that candy!” she yells.

Right.  The Star Scout Tracking Gumdrop.  Apparently it’ll send out a distress signal if you get trapped.  You fish around in your pocket, peel off the wrapper, and pop it in your mouth.

…and immediately wish you hadn’t.  It tastes *rancid*.  Does this thing come with an expiration date?  Or did Krysta just let it ferment in pickle juice and fish oil?

“Welp, guess it’s back to just the two of us,” you say to your darling wife.

So this is it - the start of your mission.  Until you place one of the three data gathering devices, you’ve been instructed not to contact Vhaja back on the Lucky Break.  Based on the map, the sites you need to head towards are within the ruins, deep in the spider forest to the east, and within the cave system to the south.  And Krysta has gone off to negotiate with the Knotties at their encampment to the southeast.

    You bring up a map of the area on your comm device, noting that your next destination is a few hours walk from the landing site.
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

With one success already under your belt, you’re feeling pretty good.  Good enough to tackle what is surely the most difficult task of the adventure - making it through a forest full of spiders.  On every planet you visit, there always seems to be something that wants to snag you in webs - be it massive arachnids, adorable moths, or, your favorite, gorgeous ladies with silk-spinning abilities.  And while there is no promise there are actually any spiders in the ‘spider forest’ (and if there are, that any of them are hot-lady-shaped) you certainly walk with a spring in your step as you imagine how much fun it will be if there are.

](else-if: $stagecomplete is &#39;2&#39;)[
    So this is it, the last leg of the adventure.  You just need to plant one more data collection device and you’ll be done.  It’s been a rough time so far, but you’re feeling confident as you bring up the map of the area on your comm device.  Only a few hour’s walk to the outskirts of the forest area.
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

“Saving the best for last, are we?” says Revissa with a knowing smirk.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You raise an eyebrow at her, but she points to your backside - where your tail has been steadily wagging back and forth.  Okay, fine, so it’s true.  You’ve always been turned on by the idea of getting tangled up in webs - especially when it’s a gorgeous lady spinning the silk.  And while there is no guarantee that the ‘spider forest’ has spiders (or that they are lady-shaped spiders if there are), you won’t deny you kind of hope there will be.

](else: )[Your tail flicks behind you eagerly as you bring up the map of the local area on your comm device.  From the landing site, it’s maybe an hour’s walk to reach the edge of the forest area, and then a significantly more difficult trek to get to the location where you need to place the data device.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Revissa rolls her eyes.  “Of course you would want to check out the forest first.  What, is my shapeshifting not enough to indulge your spider obsession?”  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You cough awkwardly, and try to make excuses, but your wagging tail is a dead giveaway.  Fine, so it’s true.  You have a thing specifically for sexy spider ladies wrapping you up.  Is that so wrong?  It’s not like there’s any guarantee that the ‘spider forest’ actually has spiders in it, or, if there are, that the spiders come in hot lady form - though you’d be lying if you said you weren’t hoping they were.

]}

Fetishistic thoughts aside, the walk to the woods is otherwise uneventful.  The aurora gleams brightly overhead, causing your shadows to form gleaming, rainbow-colored silhouettes against the ground as you travel.  For a ghost planet, everything feels incredibly alive, beautifully vibrant, delightfully engaging - maybe even supernaturally so.  You wonder if this world was so breathtaking before it was destroyed, or if its inexplicable resurrection is responsible for all the wonders you’ve witnessed as you’ve explored it.

Either way, the two of you eventually reach the edge of the trees without incident.  The forest stretches endlessly ahead of you, the trees climbing high into the air.  From a distance, you had thought it must be autumn, because all the leaves were brightly colored, but this close you can see that it’s something far more fantastic.  You’re no botanist, but you know enough about nature to be aware that plants feed on sunlight, that chlorophyll in their leaves drinks in solar rays.  But the aurora must be somehow filtering the sunlight, changing its properties, which in turn imbues every leaf on every tree with a glittery sheen that refracts into rainbow prisms in pools of light on the ground.  It is, to be honest, breathtaking.

“I’ve never seen something so beautiful…” says your wife, spellbound, beside you.

You give her a roguish smile.  “Have you never looked in a mirror?”

That gets you an elbow jab between the ribs.  Revissa chides you for thinking any mere mortal could outstrip the beauty of the natural world.  Looks like chivalry is as dead here as the rest of the planet.  Or maybe you just don’t have as much game as you used to - lines like that used to work all the time when you first started dating!

However, a soft smile from your wife gives you some validation, as she holds out a hand.  And once you take it, she leads you into the trees, her eyes bright and eager to experience the wonders of the forest ahead of you.

You wisely decide not to ask her to keep an eye out for gorgeous spider ladies.

To advance between story chapters, you simply need to click the blue links, which will either reveal new parts of the current passage or take you to the next one.

On occasion, you will have more than one option, giving the story branching paths.  Sometimes, the paths will eventually reconvene, but the game ‘remembers’ the choices you made, which might influence future events.  It is also possible to encounter ‘Bad Ends’, a series of choices which makes the heroines unable to complete their mission.  When you reach Game Over screen, you will either need to retrace your steps with the back arrow (see below), or start the game over to try again.  

When starting your game over, you can begin from certain checkpoints in the story.  This is useful to avoid repeating segments you have already seen, but keep in mind that many branches in the game depend on choices you have made or secrets you have discovered in earlier sections, so jumping right ahead to a checkpoint may lock you out of some secret paths.

If you hover over the upper left portion of your screen, a curly white ‘back’ arrow will appear, taking you back to the previous passage.  If you do this, any progress made, triggers activated, options chosen, etc, will be ‘forgotten’ by the game.  This is important to keep in mind if you are trying to unlock all of the images for the image gallery, available from the main menu.

At the bottom of every page is a link to return to the Main Menu.  However, if you return to the menu, then resume your current game, your &#39;back&#39; arrow will take you back to the menu and not the previous passage within the game.  

There is also a Save Game feature.  When choosing to save your game, information about the game’s current state is stored as a cookie in the browser you are using.  Make sure that cookies are enabled or you will be unable to save your progress.  Your game will automatically load whenever you start it up.  Please note that there is only one save file, though thanks to the checkpoint system it should never be too difficult to backtrack to a story segment you enjoy.  Unfortunately, there is not currently any way to transfer save files between different computers, devices, or browsers.  This means if you change your device you will need to start the game over again.

Starphoria is a universe created by Sekikumo and TheAmberBub, used as a setting for many stories, roleplaying sessions, and tabletop campaigns.  It features a galaxy full of magic, technology, and adventure!

There are hundreds of different species scattered throughout the worlds of Starphoria, many of them strange, grotesque, monstrous, or even non-organic.  However, all humanoid species are purely female in shape and form.  Everyone in Starphoria who isn’t a weird slug creature, a rock monster, a robot, or some other unusual critter is a gorgeous woman.  And on top of that, those gorgeous women always seem to run afoul of kinky perils.  Clothing gets shredded or destroyed at the slightest touch, entire cultures are built around bondage, petrification, or transformation, and most people seem quick to jump into bed with each other without much pretense.  It’s a playground for the strange predilections of its authors, and it doesn’t pretend to be anything else.

While the history and lore of Starphoria is expansive and ever-evolving, for the purposes of this game, knowing about these factions should be enough to get you up to speed.


**The Kemomi Empire**

The Kemomi are animal-eared women with the traits of cats, foxes, and wolves, with centuries of inter-breeding making them essentially a single species (though usually with dominant features of one of the three).  Within the Empire’s sphere of influence are also the bunny-eared Usami, the aquatic Pescans, and the bushy-tailed Squira.  

**The Elvaan Federation**

Long-eared, lithe-bodied Elvaans are graced with lifespans that are measured in centuries, a fact that often leads to them feeling they are superior to other races.  Far from unified, the Federation is a loose coalition among different subraces of the species, which are roughly grouped into the Blanche and Noire.  

Fiercely hierarchical with a powerful class of nobility, the Elvaans were known for enslaving members of other species or transforming them into decorative statues - especially Kemomi.  Tensions over this practice eventually exploded into a bloody, years-long war, which has only recently ended with a tentative truce.

**Knotties**

A relatively minor species of women on the galactic stage, who have tendril-like growths on their heads instead of hair.  Their entire culture is centered around the art of bondage and restraint.  

**Spider Queens**

A race of war-like conquerors, bearing the upper torso of a powerfully built woman, and the lower body of a monstrous spider.  The only reason they aren’t a major galactic power is that queens are fiercely territorial and constantly battle each other for supremacy, limiting their ability to mobilize on a scale that can threaten the major powers - though isolated or remote colonies often prove tempting targets for individual queens.

**Tsunojians**

A species of horned women who were once aggressive and war-like, until they restructured their culture to focus on sports and other non-violent forms of competition.  Known for hosting the galaxy’s most intense and elaborate game shows.

**The Shackled Sisters**

A fanatical cult of Knottie monks who believe the ideal state of existence is to be in permanent, inescapable bondage - and who wish to forcibly ‘convert’ other beings to sharing in that joy.

**Star Scouts**

A galaxy-wide peace-keeping organization of magical girls.  Anyone, from any species can become a Star Scout, so long as they have a pure heart and a desire to do good.

[[Back to the Main Menu-&gt;A00]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="63" name="FA02" tags="" position="1075,1150" size="100,100">After only a few minutes of walking, you find yourself totally enmeshed in nature.  The trees close in around you, concealing the rest of the planet’s scenery from view.  Leaves crunch and crack beneath your feet as you walk, each one letting out little sparks of iridescence as you release whatever energy remains trapped within them after falling from their branches. All around you, you hear the chattering of birds, see the motion of scurrying insects, and can even smell the pollen of blooming flora filling the air around you.

It would be easy to forget you’re here for a reason.  In fact, for a short while, you do.  But eventually you pull out your comm device and bring out a topological map of the area, trying to pick the best way forward.
(set: $FBStart to false)(set: $FCStart to false)(set: $FDStart to false)

[[Plan your route-&gt;FA03]]

Though Revissa loves nature, she finds maps of it artificial and uninteresting.  So as you pore over the readout on your device, she wanders off to inspect some local flora.  But you don’t mind - it’s a perfect opportunity to put your wilderness survival skills to the test!  You might have gotten rusty cooped up in a spaceship for most of your adult life, but you’ve still got the in-born talent of a kemomi to fall back on.

After some deliberation, you pick out three viable trails through the woods.  The first is the low road, taking you along the path of a river cutting through a winding ravine.  The second is the high road, taking you in a curved arc alongside the trajectory of the steep cliffs that encircle the western reaches of the forest.  Finally, you could take the middle road, the shortest in distance, but with no discernible landmarks to follow.  You’d basically be wandering blind through the thickest tangle of forest. 

All the options have their benefits and drawbacks, but after considering from every angle, you make your decision.  Revissa really only seems interested in the local plants, so it seems like you’re free to go in whatever direction you want.

[[Take the high road-&gt;FB01]]

[[Take the middle road-&gt;FD01]]

(set: $lewdpollen to false)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="65" name="FB01" tags="" position="1000,1300" size="100,100">(set: $FBStart to true)
In the end, you opt for the high road.  It might be the longest of the three choices, but it’s also, in your opinion, the safest.  Moving along the side of the cliff will give you a vantage point from which you can overlook the entire forest area, allowing you to spot any obvious signs of danger.  Not to mention you can get the lay of the land, and pick out the best route to reach the destination from afar.  Maybe even figure out why this place is called the Spider Forest.

And so you follow the plan.  Heading west, you find a ridge overlooking the area and head across it, always trying to keep to the higher ground.  The forest is still thick here, but now whenever you climb a tree you are treated to an amazing view of not just the entire forest, but also the landscape beyond it.  You can see the landing site, the scattered tents of the Knottie camp, and the sprawl of ancient ruins just past it.  But… still no spiders.

Not that you were hoping for spiders, or anything… but at the same time, you are a bit upset at the lack of truth in advertising.  Who even named it that, anyway?

“Jyumon did,” Revissa informs you when you ask her.  “She had a bad experience with a jungle expedition once, and from then onwards just assumed every forest was a Spider Forest.”

Fair enough.  And in her defense, most forests the galaxy over are teeming with spiders.  This one seems to be the exception.  Noting your annoyance, Revissa wanders off into the trees for a moment, searching for something.  After a while, she calls you over.

“There you go!” she says proudly.  “Spiders!  In the forest!”

You follow her finger… and sure enough, there is, indeed, a whole nest of tiny arachnids scurrying about in a dead, hollowed-out tree.  Each one is about the size of your fingernail.  They’re covered in bright pink fuzz, and seem to have a whole little society built here, more like a colony of ants than anything else.  Adorable, to be sure, but nothing sexy about it.  Where are the gorgeous spider babes here to wrap you up?!

Revissa just rolls her eyes, even though you didn’t say that out loud.  You grin sheepishly and motion to a log a few meters away.  Good place to take a rest.  She agrees, and the two of you sit down and set down your gear.

(if: $lewdpollen is true)[And then… you take off more than that.  A strange warmth suddenly grips you, and you find yourself peeling off your boots.  And your pants.  Your shirt, your underwear.  What’s happening? Why are you suddenly so… horny?

“The pollen from earlier,” Revissa remarks between heavy breaths.  “From that flower you disturbed.  It must have had… aphrodisiac properties…”

Her face flushes as she reaches over and takes your hand. The two of you lock eyes, expressions of desire evident on both of your faces.  Triggering that pollen was a mistake to be sure, but… you see no reason whatsoever why you shouldn’t capitalize on that mistake right now.]

After careful consideration, you decide on taking the low road.  According to your map, simply following the river’s path will eventually take you a mere half-mile from the destination point, minimizing your chances of getting lost or distracted.  

And so you head to the side of the river.  From one bank to the other it is maybe 30 feet across, though looking over the edge you can see that it gets reasonably deep in places, deep enough that you couldn’t just wade across it.  Thankfully, it is flowing at a pretty manageable pace, though sadly your location is upstream from the direction of the current, so you won’t just be able to sail your way there.

Either way, you make quite good progress following the river’s meandering trail, deciding to stick to the bank instead of venturing off into the trees.  Revissa remarks at all the fascinating plants springing up in the mineral-rich silt at the sides of the stream, happily collecting leaf and seed samples from the ones she finds most interesting and stowing them in her pack.  It is, altogether, a rather uneventful journey, though after about an hour of walking you come across something that surprises you.

Poking out of a tree is a metal spigot, standing out like a sore thumb in the otherwise pristine environment unmarred by the intervention of civilization.  The faucet at the end of the spigot is dripping with the residue of a clear amber liquid, which has piled up in a small puddle at the ground beneath it.  An overwhelming sweet, honey-like scent wafts from the liquid, suggesting it’s some kind of tree nectar rich in natural sugars.  But what’s it doing here, and who’s collecting it?

“I can’t believe it!” Revissa remarks.  “This forest is so beautiful!  Who would dare spoil it by harvesting its resources?”

That is actually an excellent question.  Looking around, you do see a path leading through the trees that looks like it was worn down not by local wildlife, but humanoid feet.  Has someone made an outpost here?  It bears investigating… but poking around could be dangerous if the culprits were smugglers of some sort - not to mention you’d be taking time away from your mission objectives.

(if: $lewdpollen is true)[And yet, as you ponder the choice, you can’t help but take notice of your wife.  The defiant look in her eyes, the slight curl of annoyance on her lips, the adorable way her little deer tail flicks to the side when she’s upset at something.  She’s always the most beautiful when she’s mad.  

You can’t help yourself but feel massively turned on.  In fact, your body is completely gripped by a warmth that defies explanation, and as soon as you register the desire it becomes impossible to ignore, demanding that you act on your impulses immediately.

At the end of the day, you’re just here to plant the data device and leave.  So the direct route seems the best option for the job.  Sure, it’s a thick, impenetrable tangle of trees and foliage, but you’re not some primeval hunter fighting her way through an ancient forest.  You come from a galaxy-spanning civilization with access to tech that would be inconceivable to your distant ancestors.  Technology like a wrist-mounted comm device that can access the scanners back on the Lucky Break in orbit to display a holographic map of the topography.

How could you possibly get lost with something like that?

…an hour of walking later, you find out.  You were so certain you were heading the right way, yet every time you check the map, it displays your position as farther and farther off course.  

“Maybe it’s busted,” Revissa suggests after a while.

“It’s not busted!” you protest.  “See?  The location data is updating properly.  If there was an uplink error it would tell me!”

Your wife shrugs.  “Then maybe you’re just bad at reading it.”

Your pride does not allow you to even entertain that option.  Surely there’s something else at play here.  But what?  And… even if you knew what it was, what, exactly, are you planning on doing about it?

“Let’s just stop and ask for directions,” Revissa eventually suggests.  You raise an eyebrow at the absurdity of the statement.  “What?  I’m a druid, remember?  I can talk to plants!”

For some reason, some sort of stubborn, primal part of your psyche feels opposed to that plan.  You can figure it out, you just need more time!  If anything, Revissa is the one being unreasonable, doubting your pathfinding skills!  Surely you’ll reach your destination eventually.  The forest isn’t *that* big!  

Though… maybe she would be happier with you if you just went along with her idea anyway.  Wives can be like that sometimes.  Or you could just give up entirely and head back the way you came in defeat.

(if: $lewdpollen is true)[And… come to think about it.  All of this walking has made you surprisingly… hot and bothered.  In fact, just looking at your gorgeous wife makes you bite your lower lip in desire.  Maybe what everyone needs right now is a bit of… relaxation.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="68" name="FA04" tags="" position="1175,1275" size="100,100">The adventure can wait.  Revissa is clearly interested in the local plants, and she deserves the chance to investigate them to her heart’s content.  What kind of wife would you be if you pulled her away from that?  Especially considering how much she has given up, living with you in a cramped, broken-down starship.  She’s a student of nature, an animist, a druid, someone who loves the outdoors even more than you do - and, given her life’s history, has considerably more first-hand experience living in it.  

And so, in deference to this, you don’t interrupt her as she studies the fantastical flora of this strange world.  Instead, you just quietly walk up beside her, laying a gentle hand on her shoulder as she looks into the bulb of some sort of pink-ish colored blossom.

“What’cha lookin’ at?” you begin to say, but you don’t even get two syllables in before the unexpected pressure of your hand causes Revissa to yelp in surprise!

You should have known better.  Despite all her training and experience, she still has the instincts of a deer - a prey animal.  She practically leaps into the air from your startling presence, losing all concentration over whatever ritual she was conducting with the plant.  As a result, the bulbous bulb opens and lets out a pungent puff of pollen, filling the air around the two of you and making you both sneeze.

And so, your only reward for trying to be a conscientious and accommodating spouse is a dirty look and a painful jab in the shin with the butt of her staff.  Chivalry really *is* dead.  In no further mood to talk, she just sullenly follows after you as you proceed with your adventure.  As before, there are three paths before you.

It seems even cleaner this high up, perhaps fortified by some winds blowing in from the cliffs up above.  Revissa seems happy as well, even going so far to shrug off her clothing and stand naked amongst the trees, drinking in the beauty of the world around her.  Though if you’re being perfectly honest, the most beautiful thing here is her.  Your heart races as you watch the wind flick her long hair braid around behind her, and an errant beam of sunlight filters through the trees to highlight the ritual tattoos on her gorgeous body.

It’s all so perfect… but you can think of a way to make it even better…

Revissa, thankfully, is completely into it.  Seems she got just as heavy a dose of that pollen as you did.  And neither of you are in any mood to try and fight it.  That’s part of why you love her so much.  For all her bluster, she’s just as much of a horn-dog as you are.  Your sex life as you travel the stars is incredibly active and wonderfully varied, and Revissa is always happy to indulge all your weirdest desires.

Today, however, your only desire is to make her scream out in ecstasy.  And to achieve that goal, you pull out all the stops.  The two of you roll through the brush as you roll in the hay, panting and moaning and working up quite the sweat.  All the local critters smartly scatter away as you tumble around amongst the leaves, because neither of you are putting much effort looking out for where you’re going.  A dereliction of duty for the nature druid among you, to be sure.  And as it turns out, a rather critical one.

About half an hour into your steamy encounter, you stumble backwards towards the hollowed out tree you spied earlier, teeming with cute fuzzy spiders.  Spiders which, unlike the other nearby fauna, had not abandoned their posts even as the love-making giants thrashed about.  Which means that the two of you end up with skin and fur covered in highly alarmed and deeply annoyed spiders as the wood of their home splinters around you.

“Oh no … sorry about that — yeee-ouch!” Revissa yells.  Several of the little buggers have climbed on top of her, biting her with tiny, but highly effective fangs.

The same happens to you.  Despite it being your fault, you still snarl in annoyance as your naked skin gets peppered with welts.  Just wanting to get out of here as fast as possible, you stand up, shaking your body frantically to dislodge as many of the pesky critters as you can.  But then, suddenly, you feel woozy.  Your legs lock up, you stumble forward, then fully fall right back down to the floor.

“P-paralytic… v-venom…” Revissa murmurs.

“And r-really… p-potent…” you stammer, as your limbs stiffen and your muscles lock in place.

And just like that, the two of you become completely frozen, naked and helpless, among a nest of angry arachnids.

The tiny spiders&#39; venom worked quickly and effectively, utterly immobilizing you and your wife before you had a chance to scramble away.  The two of you can only lay there, staring helplessly into each other’s eyes, as the daunting realization sets in that you are both entirely at the mercy of these cute, fuzzy creatures.

There is, at least, a bit of good news - the spiders are vegetarians.  As you lay there you can see nibbles taken out of the nearby leaves.  That’s a relief.  The bad part is - they are also fiercely territorial, and the entire colony has gone into high alert mode now that their home has been endangered.  For them, the top priority is neutralizing the threat they have been faced with.  And as spiders, they know exactly one way to get that done.

That they manage to completely cocoon the two of you in the space of ten minutes is not all that surprising to you.  There are, after all, hundreds of the little guys to spread the work out amongst them.  That they know how to apply leverage to bend your legs at the knees and wrench your arms behind your back is slightly more surprising.  When they start to gag you it begins to dawn on you that there must not only be strength, but also intelligence in numbers.  And… maybe even a bit of perversity, considering they don’t expend any silk to cover your chests.  Or perhaps they just know it isn’t necessary, since even with the amount they use, it’s clear the two of you aren’t going anywhere.

But beyond on all that, what shocks you the most is the spiders even managed to hoist the two of you into the air.  They form a complicated system of winches and pulleys with their silk, treating the two of you like a construction project.  A heavy branch high up is used as a counterbalance, anchored to you with webbing then gnawed away from its tree so it falls to the ground, yanking you and Revissa upwards in the process.  And once there, you’re fastened with more expertly woven tethers to keep you suspended above the ground, now unable to get any leverage or support to enact an escape.

To put it bluntly - you’re screwed.  Even after the venom wears off and you’re no longer paralyzed, the taut silk ensures you are both completely, utterly incapable of mounting even the most basic of escape attempts.  The only consolation is that this is *all* they seem to want to do with you.  Once the threat to their home is properly contained, the spiders all skitter away, leaving you both trussed up in the air above them.

Thinking back to your briefing, you recall that all the material on this spectral planet is made of ‘ghost matter’, meaning that so long as it is touching you, you won’t need to eat or sleep, nor will you even age a day.  That’s good… because it seems likely you’ll be stuck here for a long, long time…

But, bound and gagged as you are, expertly anchored to a number of strong, sturdy trees, you make not even a lick of headway in escaping.  And when those days turn into weeks, and then months, you eventually just stop trying at all.  It’s pointless to bother - nothing you do has any effect.  

And as the months become years, and the years become centuries, the two of you become a literal part of the forest.  Birds build nests on your head.  Little critters take up residence beneath the floof of your tail.  Frightened animals hide from predators by scrunching themselves up between your exposed breasts.

You have no idea what happened to the rest of your crew, but it eventually becomes clear they’re never going to find you.  Perhaps they were caught by something else on this planet.  Not a remote possibility, given how even a colony of tiny spiders managed to trap you and Revissa with such complete finality that it is becoming clear the rest of your lives will be spent here.

At least Revissa finally got her wish to spend more time enveloped in nature.  You just wish you had a bit more freedom in the matter.

Eventually, you are forced to concede that escape is impossible - all you can do is wait quietly and hope for rescue.

If there’s one silver lining, it’s the Star Scout homing beacon you swallowed at the start of the adventure.  And so as the hours drag on, you pray that’s enough to lead someone out here to find you.  

In the end, it happened while you were asleep.  Krysta and Vhaja found their way to your location and cut you down, carrying you back to the Lucky Break, where they took the time to properly remove all the webbing from your body.  It was almost like peeling off a second skin.  Though thankful to have been saved, you are then delivered the unfortunate news that the data collection devices were damaged by the elements - making your mission a failure.

So that leaves you with no choice to head back into non-restricted space with your tail between your legs.  Maybe next time, you’ll be more careful.  If there even is a next time - Vhaja sure won’t be contacting you again for any more missions.

And while she does make out a meep of protest, you can see in her eyes she wouldn’t mind at all if you take things further.

Well, who are you to argue with that?

A few minutes later, your clothing has been hastily discarded, and you are passionately pressed against your darling wife, panting loudly as you try to bring her over the edge.

Warm kisses, gentle nibbles, and dexterously applied fingers accomplish the task quite effectively.  You leave your wife happy, lethargic, and totally covered in sweat.  She smiles, leans over to kiss you, then wraps her arms around your body, content to just lose herself in the moment with you.

Brilliantly colored leaves on the ground, strong, healthy trees stretching upwards as far as the eye can see, and a naked deer girl happily bathing in the warm patches of sunlight flickering beside her.  You’ve never been much of a naturalist, but even you can’t deny there is a transcendental beauty to the scene you’ve found yourself in.

Eventually, Revissa drops into a meditating position, folding her legs and closing her eyes.  Her breathing slows, as she begins to commune with the forest around her.  You’ve seen her do this before - but not, perhaps, as often as you’d like.  Rare are the opportunities for you to immerse yourself in the beautiful outdoors like this.  

Seeing no reason to disturb her, you just lean back against the log and close your eyes.  Your own breathing slows, as you try to do your best approximation of Revissa’s meditation.  Breathe in, breathe out.  In, and out.  Let your mind wander.  Forget about your body, forget about your mission, just immerse yourself in the comforting sounds of the world around you.

Birds singing.  Insects buzzing.  Silken tethers whistling through the air and splatting against naked skin.

…wait, what?

You open your eyes just in time to see Revissa get yanked upwards and out of sight, caught by someone’s sticky fishing line of webbing.  Jumping to your feet in surprise, you follow the path she had taken, casting your gaze upwards towards the cliff face looming overhead.  And that’s where you spy the culprit of your wife’s silky abduction.

Light purple skin and ivory-white hair, shapely bodies clad in form-fitting dresses that show off all of their wonderful curves.  But on their backs are a collection of spindly spider legs, twitching and writhing with powerful strength.  Limp lines of silk fall away from the tips of their back appendages, making clear they are the method by which they weave their stringy tethers.

“Look, sister,” says one of them, pointing towards where you are standing.  “Another one!”

“Ooh… she’s cute too!  I can’t wait to snare her!” says the second.  

She tenses her legs then uses another line of silk to launch herself into the air, bringing her down towards you.  The other one stays behind, kneeling over Revissa and starting to truss her up in a snug, restrictive cocoon.  It looks like your wife won’t be able to help you right now - and if you don’t act fast, you may soon be joining her!

Sure, you have a mission.  It’s important, you know it is.  But missions come and go - there will always be more of them, even if you fail your objectives now and then.  But your relationship with your wife is one of a kind, and it’s not something you *ever* want to fail at.  So your eyes droop, then close completely, your breathing slows, and by degrees, you allow yourself to happily drift off.  Darkness takes you as you slip out of consciousness, awash in the gentle sounds of the forest.

“It’s true.  They were so cute, all snuggled up like that.  It&#39;s almost a shame to spoil it.”

“Almost.”

“Tee-hee.  Well, they are much cuter like this, wouldn’t you say?”

You awaken to a pair of tittering voices looming over you.  Groggy and disoriented, you try to reach up to brush something sticky you feel on your face away… but find that you can’t.

“...mmph?”

And, when you try to voice your surprise over this fact, you, again, find that you can’t.  It is only at this point that you open your eyes and fully grasp the situation that you’re in.

Revissa points upwards, directing your attention to a waterfall flowing down the nearby cliff face.  Well, not so much a waterfall as a … watertrickle?  You’re not really sure what to call it.  It’s a gentle stream flowing forth in a light but steady downpour, and it’s only a few minutes walk from where you are.  Seems good enough for you.  Leaving your gear behind, you move to the water, inviting Revissa to join you beneath the cool aquatic flow.

…can you be blamed if the idea of sexy waterfall bathing sets you off again, and you soon find yourself pressing your wife against the stone and nippling erotically on her ear?  Soon you’re both wet in two different ways, enjoying each other’s company amidst the sound of flowing water around you.

But your ears are still sharp enough to pick out the sound of a pebble dislodging and falling down the side of the cliff to your right.  Your body suddenly tenses, and you put a hand on Revissa’s shoulder to alert her to the sound.

Like a pair of bloodhounds hot on the trail, they sling themselves down towards your discarded items on lines of webbing and begin pawing through them, looking for a hint as to your location.

Well, crap.  It looks like you got your wish about gorgeous spider-babes.  But you’d have really preferred to face the threat with a weapon in your hand. You give Revissa a nervous glance.  Among the discarded gear is her druidic focus - a wooden staff she uses to channel her spellcraft.

But alas, the very nature of kinky kidnappings is you have no say in what happens once you’re caught.

Your captors seem split between two choices for your fate.  One is to keep the two of you for themselves as personal playthings, and the other is to give you as a present to someone named Merry.  A third option is only briefly brought up and then summarily ignored, which is to deliver you to their leader and let her decide what to do with you.  At no point is ‘letting you go’ even mentioned.

In the end, they seem to settle on that second option.

“They really are so adorable,” one says.  “Merry will love them!”

“Yeah, cute floofy couples are her favorite,” the other agrees.

You and Revissa are never consulted about what your personal preference would have been.  Other than the occasional groping, you’re both basically ignored.  At one point, you attempt to wiggle and worm your way across the floor to try to get away,  but that just elicits a chuckle from one of the women as she yanks you by the tail and drags you back to where you were.

And so, once their deliberations cease, you are each picked up and slung over a shoulder, then carried off deeper into the cliff region, towards the opening of a dark and ominous cave.

But the spider women seem perfectly capable of navigating without light, picking out twists and turns through the extensive cave system.  At this point, even if you were to somehow escape the webbing, you’d have no idea how to actually get back to daylight anyway.

Eventually they reach an area that seems to have the trappings of domestic living, and carry you into a section cordoned off by sheets of webbing to be someone’s home.

“Merry, look what we brought you!” says one of the pair.

“You’re gonna love them!” says the other.

Before long, a third spider-woman emerges.  This one has bright pink skin and big, beady green eyes, wearing a pretty silken dress and with fuzzy fur covering her back legs.  She immediately squees in delight when she sees the gifts that have been brought for her.

“Eeeeeeee!  Omigosh!  Look how cute and fuzzy they are!” she exclaims.

You and Revissa can only mewl helplessly into your gags as you are again poked and prodded and groped by the silk-clad cutie.  The pair explain they found you cuddled together in the forest, which only makes Merry happier.

“Aaahhhh!  You two love each other, don’t you!  Well, you should!  You’re both so adorable!  You make the best couple!”  She looks towards the bearer of her gifts.  “And… I can keep them?”

“You can,” one lady says.

“Forever and ever?”

“And ever,” the other agrees.

“Yay!  I promise I’ll take good care of them!  I’ll brush their hair and tails, and I’ll play with them every single day!”

You and Revissa let out a pair of fearful ‘mmphs’ as you realize you’re basically going to be this spider-cutie’s pets.

And so the others leave you in her expert care.  She wastes no time modifying the positioning of your webbing, cutting bits and pieces here and there, but never enough to give you any mobility or leverage to escape.  You and Revissa are pressed up together, arms behind your backs, naked breasts squished together warmly.  It is, altogether… exactly the sort of thing you’ve fetishized about for most of your life.  Can you be blamed if your tail starts wagging back and forth?

Revissa rolls her eyes at your excitement.  Altogether a rather subdued reaction from both of you, considering the fact these ladies have not, at any point, given any indication they plan on letting you go.  ‘Forever and ever’ is a long time, after all.  But at this point, you have no choice in the matter, so you might as well just enjoy it.

To your surprise, you feel a tearing at your lips as the webbing used to gag you is pulled away.  You and Revissa both start to murmur something towards your cheerful captor, but before any words get out your heads are grabbed and pushed together firmly.

“Now kiiisssssss…” she says happily.]

And so kiss you do.  It’s not like you have any choice.  Though maybe you’d have liked to get one final word in.  Because a moment later and globs of silk are woven around the backs of your heads, gluing your lips together into a kiss that will never end.

Well, there are worse fates to endure.

The webbing is surprisingly comfy, taut and snug in all the right places.  It’s like being tucked into bed.  A bed you’re never allowed to roll out of.  

Your owner makes good on her words to her friends.  She really does cuddle and coddle the two of you every single day.  She brushes your hair and tail, reads you bedtime stories, and always makes sure to keep you… stimulated.  Sometimes she does it by rubbing some kind of cream on your bodies that makes you unbearably horny, watching you and Revissa grind against each other to completion.  And sometimes she does the completing herself, either using the fingers on her humanoid arms, or by running a sturdy length of webbing between your legs and pressing it firmly against your crotch.

She dedicates a corner of her cavern home to be your display stand, and keeps the two of you anchored there for every moment of every day.  You’re just toys to her, wriggling in silk on her shelf.  Though at least you’re well-loved.  It’s… an odd feeling.  You had always fantasized about being abducted by a sexy and domineering spider lady, but it turns out a cute and indulging one is just as effective.  You hate to admit it, but maybe there is something in your kemomi blood that yearns to be… tamed.  Domesticated.  Owned.  Because that is what you are now.  A pet, a piece of property.  As the days go by, you feel like, maybe, this is what you’ve always wanted.  

However, about a week into your new life, an opportunity presents itself.  Your captor was going through your personal effects, holding up each item you’d been carrying and quizzing you about what it did.  Of course, gagged as you are, there’s no way for you to reply.  She just responds for you, in a cutesy sing-song voice, the same kind of voice someone might use to speak to their pet cat.  Amazingly… it doesn’t annoy you.  You find it kind of charming. 

But regardless of the fact, when she is done, she sets down two items from your kit onto a table very close by to where you’re bound.  Close enough… that you might just barely be able to brush up against one of them with your floofy tail.  The first item is the runic dagger Vhaja entrusted you with, apparently able to cut even spectral matter.  And the second is your wrist mounted comm device.  Might you be able to make use of one of these things to mount an escape?  Or would you just be fighting against the inevitable.  And, a better question… do you even *want* to escape?

Not that you’re not having fun being toyed with, of course, but the whole point of your obsession with spider bondage is the back-and-forth of it.  The teasing, the domineering, the futile struggles, the mocking voice of your captor when she thwarts yet another of your escape attempts.  Merry is charming and downright adorable, and she makes for a very good pet owner… but you want to be more than a pet!  You want to be a helpless prisoner at the mercy of a sexy jailor!  And you’re not getting that at the moment, which means it’s time to take a stand.

With that dagger, you might be able to cut yourself free!  And while your tail is far from prehensile, if you wag it properly you might just be able to knock it into your bound up hands.  Then with some more maneuvering, you could hopefully start making some progress on escaping.  Obviously, you might nick yourself with the blade in the process, but it would be worth it if it led to you attaining your freedom.

And so, when your captor leaves the room, you get to work.  Wag wag wag, shake shake shake, you flit your tail back and forth, trying to catch the end of the knife in your fur and gently slide it over.  Slowly, slowly, slowly, bit by bit, it gets closer and closer, until, finally, you feel it push over the edge of the table.  Now all you need to do is catch it and –

*Clatter*

–crap!  You missed!  The knife drops to the ground and scrapes against the stone floor of the cave, totally failing to connect with your hand, or any part of the webbing holding you down.  And now there’s no way for you to get it!

“Oh no!  Are you okay?!”

Merry’s voice comes from the doorway as she rushes in, instantly spying the dropped knife.  She runs over and picks it up, quickly moving it away from you.  Then she scans your body inch by inch, checking to see if it cut you anywhere.

“I’m so sorry!  I shouldn’t have left that so close.  You might have hurt yourself!” she says, with genuine concern.  “But it’s okay… I’ll make sure nothing like this ever happens again.  I’ll never leave anything at all near your body from now on, and make sure you’re wrapped up even tighter than before!”

And she does just that.  Even your tail gets wrapped in place against your butt, as the taut silk is pulled in so firmly you can’t even squirm anymore.  Well… so much for that plan.  So much for *any* plan.  You’ll never get another chance to escape again.  From now on, you’ll only ever be a helpless pet… though maybe that’s not so bad, after all.

And you’re not getting that at the moment, which means it’s time to take a stand.

If you could just switch on your comm device, you might be able to alert your friends where you are.  It’s only been a week - surely they haven’t given up on you by now.  And if they know the peril at hand is spider-themed, they might be able to properly prepare themselves to avoid getting captured like you and Revissa were.  It’s not the best plan in the world, but it’s better than nothing.  It’s not like you want to stay here and play house with Merry for the rest of your life.

…right?

Right!  You’re not ready for the drudgery of domestic living just yet.  You have a galaxy to adventure through, and a gorgeous wife to do it with.  As lovely as being smushed up against Revissa is, there’s other parts of her body you want to have the pleasure of touching.  What about her cute little butt?  The back of her head?  Her long slender legs?  That adorable spotted deer tail?  Not to mention the tantalizing cleft between her legs.  There’s a galaxy&#39;s worth of sex positions to try out with her, and you’re not going to get the chance to do it webbed up in the same position for the rest of your life!

And so, the next time Merry leaves the room, you flick your fluffy tail back and forth, gently trying to smack the ‘on’ button of your communicator.  Your tail is by no means prehensile, but you do have some control over it, which you often use to good effect to floofily stimulate your partners in bed.  And now if you could just tap into that tantric talent now, you could potentially give yourself a way home.  

*Swish, swish, wag, wag,* your tail thwaps against the surface of the table.  It’s hard to see what you’re doing, given the positioning of your head, but by degrees you manage to get a hang of things.  In your mind’s eye, you see where the little ‘start call’ button is, and try to depress it, sort of using your tail to nudge the button against a sharp corner.  It is frustratingly slow going, and after ten minutes you feel like it might be impossible.  But just as you start considering giving up, you finally feel a tiny click, and hear a pleasant buzz as the communicator switches on.

After a moment, you hear a voice.

“Melfy?  That you?”  

It’s Krysta!  The call went through!

“Mmpphh!” you yell, lamely.  “Mrrmphhhhgghhhh!”

You wiggle and squirm as hard as you can, causing the webs to make an elastic stretching sound that echoes through the walls of the room.

“You uh… you alright?”

“Mmphhh!” Revissa screams into her gag.

“Huh… sounds like you’re in trouble?  Me too, lemme tell you.  Me and Lumi only just managed to escape from that Knottie camp last night.  They were *real* good with those ropes – and even better at the whole mind-games part of it.  For a while I seriously thought i was gonna be tied up forev–”

“MRRRPGGHHH!” you growl, as loudly as you can.  

“Right… sounds like you need a rescue?  Lemme just lock-on to your coordinates and–”

But then her voice cuts out, as a pink-skinned hand picks up the comm device and switches it off.  Merry comes into your field of vision and gives you a stern look.

“Was that… a friend of yours?” she asks. Your pulse starts to race.  She’s been nothing but sunshine and rainbows up until now… but if she finds out you’ve been trying to escape…

“Well, why didn’t you tell me!” she says.  “If you had friends, you should have invited them over!  There’s plenty of room for everyone!”

Seems like the stormcloud over the rainbow was just concealing more rainbows.

“Anyway, I’ll let my sisters know to expect them!  We’ll get them all wrapped up and comfy, and then we can have a tea party!” she exclaims brightly.

Your heart sinks.  This isn’t good.  Your friends are all talented and competent, but these spider ladies are something else.  You and Revissa were caught by them, after all, and it honestly wasn’t even much of a fight.  If they know to expect company… will they be able to rescue you?  Or even… rescue themselves?

You’re nice and tightly wrapped, snug as a bug.  Your lips are eternally locked with Revissa’s, the two of you given the opportunity to kiss each other to your heart’s content, and to grind against each other whenever you’re horny.  With webbing imbued with the planet’s ghost matter, you never need to eat or sleep, and you won’t even grow any older.  You’ll get to enjoy the loving ministrations of your owner every day, who always keeps you entertained and stimulated.  What more could you ask for in life?  No more scraping by for enough credits to pay for repairs, no more risking your life on dangerous missions.

Now, all you need to do is exist, to be a warm body for Merry to play with when she pleases.  This is… paradise. There’s no need to fight anymore, no need to worry.  This is… your home now.

And, as the days become months, the months become years, and the years stretch on forever, you’re happy knowing you’ve finally found the place in the universe where you belong.

You have no idea what happened to the rest of your crew - maybe they left the planet without you.  Or maybe they were caught by some other peril on this crazy planet.  Either way, no rescue ever comes.  

Over the years, Merry gathers more pets for her collection, treating them all with love and kindness.  But you and Revissa are always her favorites.  And you always will be.

Hours later when it opens, you find yourself on the Lucky Break surrounded by your crew.

As it turns out, Vhaja was able to locate you thanks to your Star Scout distress beacon.  And though they couldn’t manage to save you directly, they did negotiate your freedom with the spider women in exchange for all the data they had gathered on the planet so far.  Sadly, that included giving over the data collection devices, meaning your mission was a failure.  But at least you have your freedom.

Though for the rest of your life, you’ll always wonder if you might have enjoyed things more being a pet…

Vhaja spins helplessly from her suspended tether anchored to the ceiling.  “Grrmphh!”

She’s none too pleased, which, also, is understandable.  Merry clearly loves a floofy lady, and Vhaja’s partner has that in abundance.

“Hrrmpphhh…” Jyumon groans with a resigned sigh.

So… yeah.  Turns out the rescue didn’t really go as planned.  Though it did go as expected.  Your crewmates didn’t even make it past the entrance to the cave system before they were all captured.

Krysta and Lumina are trussed up much like you and Revissa are, boobs squishing, lips locked against each other, though they’re stuck in a kneeling position rather than standing.  Lumina’s wings are neatly lashed together, enough to avoid mussing up her feathers but not giving them any sort of mobility or leverage.  Krysta, meanwhile, is back to her human form, it seems.  The squirrel tail comes and goes, after all.  Though Jyumon probably wishes it was still out, so that Merry would have something else to occupy her.

As it stands, the curvy fox is laid out on the spider-girl’s bed, forced to endure the cheery groping of her exposed chest as Merry chatters on about how much she loves her new pets.  Vhaja glares daggers at you as she impotently spins from the roof, as thoroughly caught and defeated as the rest of your party.

To be perfectly honest, things could not have ended up worse.  Now your entire crew is hopelessly trapped, which also means there’s no one left to come and save you.  All six of you are naked, save for Merry’s silken restraints, bound tightly and thoroughly enough to prevent any thought of wriggling free unaided, and cut off from making any sounds other than angry grunts or plaintive mewls.  In other words, you’re screwed.  Merry has you all right where she wants you, and where she wants you is nicely bundled up in her bedroom, forever and ever.

It seems your adventure has come to an end.

Which means there is nothing stopping the long-lived spider girl from keeping you for as long as she wants.  And as it turns out, as long as she wants is for ever and ever and ever.  And she gets her wish.  You and your crew spend the rest of your long, long lives as web-wrapped playthings, toys to be fondled, groped, and cuddled whenever your owner is in the mood.  At least she’s friendly.  

Needless to say, your mission is a failure, and no one back home ever hears from you again.

Thankfully, there is a small, but not insignificant silver lining.  Before the mission began, you took a Star Scout homing candy, which means that as the years go by, your distress sends out signals into space.  And, eventually, a passing scout picks up on it and investigates.  And though they aren’t able to free you directly, they do manage to negotiate some terms with the local spider-gals.  Namely, a promise for your release… in a hundred year’s time.

It’s better than nothing.  But until that day, there’s not much to do but submit to Merry’s playful whims.  You and your crew spend the rest of your long, long prison sentence as web-wrapped playthings, toys to be fondled, groped, and cuddled whenever your owner is in the mood.  At least she’s friendly.

You’re naked and defenseless, and those spider-ladies, sexy though they may be, look clearly dangerous.  It would be foolish to try and fight them in your current state.  Better to conceal yourselves and wait for them to leave.  With an anxious whisper, you ask Revissa if she can maybe cook up a camouflaging spell to hide you from their eyes.  She wrinkles her nose in worry, but eventually nods.  She’ll do her best.

She plucks some moss from a water-lodged stone nearby, borrowing some of the life energy within it to weave some primal magic around your bodies.  And, in a flash, you see your skin change in texture and color, becoming not unlike the sandy stone of the cliff face behind you.  Yes!  This is why it’s great to be married to a nature druid!  The two of you press up against the cliff and wait, holding your breath as the spider-ladies continue to investigate the area.

“Hrm… well, they couldn’t have gone far buck naked, could they, sister?”

“I doubt it.  Do you think… they might be hiding somewhere?”

“Oh, they might!  Let’s find them!”

Every muscle in your body tenses as the two arachnid women skitter around the area, carefully searching every nook and cranny for their potential prey.  Little by little, they circle around, at times coming dangerously close to your hiding place… but never looking directly at you.  After about ten minutes, they seem to be growing tired of the ordeal.  You watch as they reconvene on the forest floor below where you are standing and whisper something between themselves.  They’re too far away for you to make out the words, but it seems like they’ve cooled down a bit.  Maybe you’ll be getting out of this after all!

…

In retrospect, that was a stupid thing to think to yourself.  Because the law of narrative dictates that the most dangerous part of a nerve-wracking hiding sequence is right when the victim starts to relax.  And indeed, no sooner do you finally let yourself exhale than the two spider-ladies suddenly spin around, looking right towards the both of you!  You don’t even have a chance to process what is happening before a goopy glob of webbing sticks itself to your chest, forming a taut anchor against your skin which the woman uses to tug you downwards into her waiting arms.

“Gotcha!” she yells, taking advantage of your disorientation to glom some silk over your lips and bind your wrists and ankles together.

“And I got this one!” says the second spider, vaulting up onto the cliff and tackling Revissa to the ground.

Just like that… you’ve been caught.  You make some lame attempts at thrashing and kicking in the spider-woman’s grip, but she has the superior leverage, and soon you’re nicely wrapped up in her impossibly strong silk, unable to do anything but look up at her in helpless fear.

“You almost had us fooled,” she giggles, scooping you up into her arms and slinging you over a shoulder.  “But then I noticed that waterfall… and the way the stream was being disrupted slightly.”

She gives a playful tug on your tail.

“Maybe keep this tucked in better next time and you won’t give yourself away.”

Your heart sinks as you realize it was your own damn fault the two of you have been caught.  But there’s nothing you can do about it anymore.

What you need is to create some kind of distraction to draw their attention away from your gear.  Then you can scoop up your stuff and make a run for it, hopefully avoiding being tracked down.  You whisper a few words to your wife.  Her magical abilities are limited without her staff, but maybe she can still do a bit of shapeshifting?

“Nothing big,” she tells you, “and nothing dangerous.  But maybe a bird or a cat or something.”

That seems as good of a plan as anything.  She’ll turn into an animal and keep them occupied, while you head down to your stuff and gather it up.  You agree on a location to meet back up once you’ve gotten away from them.  The only question is, what kind of animal should she turn into?

Fighting is also out of the question - you’re physically powerful, to be sure, but spider silk is stronger than steel.  In all your past dealings with web weaving hotties, brute force was never the solution.  Stamina and adrenaline only get you so far, and once it’s gone, all that’s left is the unbreakable tension in the silken fibers wrapped around you.

So… your best bet is to talk it out.  Make a deal.  Maybe offer them something.  Don’t present yourself as a threat, and maybe convince them their best interest would be better served letting you go free.  At the very least, spending some time talking might give you the opportunity to think of a better plan.

In a low whisper, you explain to Revissa your thinking.  She doesn’t like it, but she also doesn’t have any better ideas.  So with one last quick kiss, you step out into view and call to the ladies below you.

“Hey try not to get the stuff too dirty,” you call out playfully to them.  “I just had a bath.”

Both of them immediately wheel around to face you, eyes zeroing in predatorily.  

“Ohhh… she’s cute!” one lady says.

“I’m more than cute,” you reply eagerly, hoping your enthusiasm piques their interest in what you have to say.  “I’m resourceful, too.  I’ve actually got some information about this planet you might be interested in — ack!”

You are cut off as a line of silk shoots out from the tips of one of their back legs at astonishing speed.  Your instincts are enough to help you dodge the first one, and your reflexes help with the second.  But your agility comes short at avoiding the third one as it manages to snare you around the ankle.

“Gotcha!” yells the arachnid woman from below, giving a powerful tug on the fishing line to drag you backwards towards the edge of the cliff.

Frantically, you scramble to hold onto something, but your fingers come up short, and then suddenly you’re airborne.  It’s not too far of a drop, you know, but you still go into survival mode as you feel the wind whip through your hair, bracing yourself for a rough impact.  Instead, you land against something warm, soft, and springy - a web net quickly woven to safely stop your descent, spread between the spider-lady’s spindly back legs.

Your mind, to its credit, quickly comes up with a snarky quip.

“Oh, so *this* is where I left my hammock!”

The lady responds to your brilliance by roughly dropping you to the ground then pinning you there with her body.  You wince as her knee digs into your chest.

“Okay – ow!  But really… hear me out.  I have something to offer you — hrrmpgh!”

Your words stop as your lips get sealed with a thick glob of silk.

“The only thing prey like you has to offer is your adorable little body,” she says, as more tethers weave themselves between her back legs.

…well crap.  This went about as bad as it possibly could have gone.

A panicked squeak rings out from above you, followed by the sounds of a brief scuffle.  And then the voice of the second spider-lady calling out.

“You were right, sis - there *were* two of them.  And number two is even cuter than number one!”

“Have you got it under control?” asks the first lady, as she pins your arms to your side and wraps your ankles together tightly.

“Yup!  Spinning her up now!”

Correction.  With Revissa caught too, *now* things have gone as bad as they possibly could have.

You put up some token resistance, but it doesn’t really amount to much.  Instead you just get spun round and round, helpless to resist as warm, wet silk cools and contracts around your body.  As expected, your physical strength proves useless once the cocoon is fully woven around you, not providing even an inch of give as you squirm uselessly against it.  Your voice comes out in fearful, mewling grunts, your gagged lips unable to form any coherent words.

Your captor watches bemusedly for a moment, before scooping you up in her arms and slinging you over a shoulder.

“Now those are the sounds I like to hear from my prey!”

And then with one last playful squeeze on your rump, she slings herself back towards the cliff to meet up with her partner.

At times you think of trying to wriggle free and throw yourself back down to the forest floor, but you know that won’t do you any good.  She’ll just scoop you up once more.  At this point, any opportunity for resistance has passed.  You’re caught, and nothing you do is going to change that.

It doesn’t take long for her to reach the cliff face once more.  And when you arrive, you see that the other lady has been occupying herself by playing with Revissa’s cocooned form.  She, like you, has been rendered totally powerless, able to do little more than writhe meekly in the grip of her captor.

Once she lands, the one who caught you sets you down next to your wife, letting the pair appreciate the sight of their two catches side by side.

“They really are adorable, aren’t they?” one coos.

“They are!  And for once, they’re all ours!  Tula doesn’t know they’re here…” says the other.

“Which means, we can have them all for ourselves!  Our secret little treasure stash!” giggles the first one.

You and Revissa exchange panicked glances.  Caught like you are, it’s obvious you won’t be escaping under your own power.  But the way these ladies are talking… it sounds like they have every plan to keep the two of you as their personal playthings.  Things are looking quite dire indeed…

…even if this is the kind of thing you fetishize about every night.  

“Grrmmpgghh!” Revissa yells futilely into her gag.  She kicks and thrashes, but accomplishes nothing more than providing entertainment for the pair of spider-y cuties.

“Aww… I don’t think she’s happy about the arrangement!” says one of them.

The other one kneels down and cups her chin with a hand.  “Well… too bad for her.  Because we caught her, fair and square.  And we’re never… *ever* gonna let her go… are we sis?”

“Never ever!” the other one says brightly.  “You two will be our little secret!  We won’t have to share you with anyone!”

“But don’t worry… we’ll play with you.  Every.  Single.  Day.”

The other one does the same to Revissa.  And then, in a fit of giggles, they have their way with the two of you.  Groping, fondling, cuddling, kissing, teasing, stimulating, ravishing, every inch of your bodies a playground for their wickedly erotic desires.  Even Revissa, defiant as she was, eventually succumbs to the pleasure, getting reduced to a mewling, orgasmic puddle by their dextrously probing hands.

It’s several hours later when they’ve finally had their fill with the two of you.  Once they do, they pick you both up and drag you to an alcove in the craggy cliff face, finding a little gap that’s shielded from the elements and not immediately visible - unless you know what you’re looking for.  They layer the space with gobs of webbing, forming a sticky net into which they deposit their two squirming prizes.  Both of you are too tired, too defeated to even pretend at fighting back.  And soon your cocooned bodies are fastened in place, tautly tethered amongst the stands of the net.]

As the pair of sisters admire their handiwork, Revissa makes a few plaintive wiggles, mmph-ing weakly into her gag.  That just makes them laugh all the more, confident in the inescapability of your bonds.  And then with one final squeeze of your breasts, they skitter away, leaving you alone in their hidden alcove.  You both writhe helplessly for a few hours more after they leave, but it is entirely without use.  There’s no way in hell you’ll ever be able to escape… meaning all you can do is hang here and await your next visit.

Over your shoulder, you see Revissa has morphed herself into a bright green chimpanzee, hooting and hollering and rolling around while screeching wildly.  Despite it being your own plan, you still flatten your ears against your head in annoyance at the sound.

But it does seem to do the trick.  Both spider-ladies immediately pick up on the noise and sling themselves up to the cliff area to investigate, giving you the chance to climb down in their wake.

You hear the *thwap* of silk firing from spinnerets, followed by something slamming against a rock wall.  And then Revissa’s surprised voice groaning in pain.

“Woah - it turned into a cutie!”

“Well… don’t just stand there!  Wrap her up!”

Crap crap crap!  You scramble to pick up your things, even as you can hear Revissa being made short work of as silk spins around her.  It looks like you’re going to need to rescue her!  But at least you’ve got your gear now–

*Splort*

You get slammed to the ground as a sticky glob of webbing gloms onto your back.  Not good!  For a few moments you flail about lamely, trying to get free… before a many-legged shadow looms above you.

“Found another cutie!” a spider-woman announces, as she presses down against your body.

The subsequent attempt to spin around and face her is met with more pressure, pinning you in place.  Followed by spindly legs picking you up and starting to twirl you round and round.  In the space of a few seconds, your limbs are pressed tightly against your body, and your skin vanishes beneath the tight embrace of reams of expertly woven webbing, stretching from your feet all the way to your lips.

Behind you, you see that Revissa has changed herself into a solar phoenix-wren, a tiny bird with feathers coated with ultra-reflective gloss that magnifies the intensity of the sun tenfold as a defensive mechanism.  It’s so bright you can barely see where you’re going as you shimmy towards the end of the ledge.

More sounds of inexpertly aimed web snares missing their target echo through the forest, allowing you to get to your pile of gear unmolested.  But as you start scooping things up, a thought occurs to you.  If the equipment were to all vanish, the spider-ladies would obviously notice and realize their prey had escaped.  But what if you were to leave the most obvious stuff behind?   After all, replacement clothing and weapons could be manifested using the molecular recombiner capsules Jyumon gave you.  Though that would mean you wouldn’t have access to those capsules if you needed them later.

Sadly, there was no time to recover the data collection devices, and so the research mission is a bust.  But at least you escaped with your freedom.

Watching the spider lady drop through the air towards you, your hand reaches for the blaster pistol at your side.  Though you’re better in melee than at range, you get the sense this lady isn’t going to give you the chance to close the distance to her.

Unfortunately, she’s moving too fast for you to get a good bead on her either.  Maybe it’s a shot Krysta could have pulled off, but your aim has never been anywhere near as good as hers.  The blaster’s energy discharge goes wide, leaving scorching holes in a nearb tree and causing birds to flutter away in a chorus of wingbeats.  Plenty of damage done - but not to your target.

That missed opportunity proves to be the last one you get.  As she lands, her back legs twitch, sending out a half-dozen lines of webbing hurtling towards you with far better precision than you had just shown.  One catches your wrist, glomming up the gun in your hand, and another strikes your face, locking your lips beneath a layer of warm webbing.  A third wraps around your waist, giving your opponent a perfect piece of leverage to yank you into her waiting grip.

Thrown off balance, all you can do is make a surprised ‘mmph’ sound as the lady uses the sharp points of her legs as a knife to slice away every inch of your clothing.  You try to squirm from her grip, but she doesn’t let you keep your balance long enough to accomplish much of anything.  Instead, she just starts spinning you round and round, winding layers of warm, wet silk over your defenseless body.

As embarrassing as it is to admit, your best choice is to make a run for it.  Once you’ve put some distance between them, maybe you can find a way to sneak up on them and regain the advantage.

It’s not the best plan, but it’s the only one you’ve got.  Leaving your rest spot behind, you rush into the trees, not even bothering to look back as you plunge recklessly into the forest.  Right now, the most important thing is to just not get caught yourself.  Only once you’re sure you’re safe can you figure out where to go from there.

You duck under branches, leap through bushes, and barrel past confused wildlife, making a lot of noise, but hopefully going fast enough that your pursuer won’t be able to follow.  Though, after a while, you slow your steps and proceed with more caution, doing your best to cover your tracks and thoroughly give the spider-lady the slip.  In the back of your mind, you realize in your haste you’ve also completely lost your bearings, meaning that getting back to where Revissa was is going to be a huge pain.  Luckily, you still have the map on your comm device - but as you glance down at it, the readings don’t seem to make any sense.  Have you gotten even more lost than you thought?  Or is there something supernatural at play here messing with your navigation?  Maybe you’d have a better chance of understanding it if you’d explored this part of the forest before rushing blindly though it.

Either way, you finally decide you’ve gone far enough, and slump down against the trunk of a tree to catch your breath.  Your heart is pounding, pulse racing, body both tense and exhausted from the chase.  And now that you finally have a moment to close your eyes and think, you have the time to regret abandoning your wife to whatever fate those dangerous (though also undeniably sexy) spider ladies have for her.  Were you wrong?  Should you have stood and fought?  What if you never see her again?

You might have been plagued by self-doubt for much longer than that, but thankfully, the next few minutes leave the point moot.  Because as you lay there, trying to calm yourself, you suddenly feel a pressure on the back of your head, a hand pulling you forward so that your lips meet a woman’s tender kiss.

“Mmmph?”

Opening your eyes, you see the spider lady who was chasing you suspended upside down on a length of webbing.  Instantly, you try to pull away, but several globs of webbing rain down to restrain your ankles and wrists against the tree behind you.  This gives her the chance to enjoy every instant of her long, passionate kiss, saliva dripping from her mouth as she finally pulls away.

You look up at her with terror and confusion, but she just smiles and pokes your nose.

“I figured you deserved a little reward for giving me such a good workout,” she says brightly.  “But now, let’s get you wrapped up and back together with your cute little friend.”

Stuck and exhausted, you are unable to put up anything even resembling a fight.  A slash from the sharp point of one of her back legs cuts away your clothing, then a gentle spin from her humanoid arms sends you whirling round and round as the silk emerging from her body coils you up nice and tight.  Soon you’re bundled up completely, from the feet to just below the nose, bound, gagged, and totally at your pursuer’s mercy.

That suggests they are both physically strong and dangerously accurate with their web shooters.  Which means fighting is a dangerous proposition - but running is too.  More likely than not, all you’d manage to do is tire yourself out before getting overpowered and wrapped up anyway.

Better, then, to try the diplomatic solution.  You’ve always thought of yourself as having something of a silver tongue.  Or, at least, a tongue good enough at other things that women who have you at their mercy decide to let their guards down around you.  Hopefully you’ll be able to maintain that streak of luck.  As the spider woman drops down in front of you, you make a motion of raising your hands above your head, trying to communicate non-violent intent.

“Now hold on… let’s just talk this out,” you say to the lady as she lands about twenty feet away from where you’re standing.

She tilts her head to the side.  “Oh?  And what exactly do we have to talk about?”

“Well… rather than just kidnapping both of us straight away, don’t you think you should find out who we are and why we’re here?”

The lady considers for a moment.  “I suppose so.  But I want some assurance you won’t try to pull one over on me while we chat.  Toss away your weapons.”

Your body tenses.  Without weapons, you’ll be at a severe disadvantage.  But you were already at that point anyway.  Might as well fully commit to talking things over.

With a nod, you pull your sword from your back and your blaster from its holster, and throw both off to the side.

“Hmm… but how do I know you’re not hiding something else on you?  I think you’d better strip down entirely.”

You suppress the urge to smile.  This is actually exactly what you wanted.  Once she sees how fit and sexy you are, she’ll probably want to get intimate.  And if she’s getting intimate, she’s letting down her guard.  A perfect opportunity for you to get the drop on her.  Or, worst case scenario, at least she’ll take a liking to you.

And so, with careful movements, you begin peeling off your clothes.  Boots and pants, cape and shirt.  You make a bit of a show out of it, swaying your hips and flexing your muscles to really give her a sense of what you’ve got to offer.  And from the looks in her eyes, she likes what she sees.  Once you finally wiggle out of your panties and drop them to the floor, you cock an eyebrow in her direction, letting her dictate the next move.

“Now then… walk towards me.  Slowly.  No sudden moves.”

Excellent.  Looks like she’s eager to sample the goods after all.  You do as you’re told, swishing your tail enticingly as you slowly draw near.  Her eyes never leave your body as you advance.

“Now then,” she says as you stop right in front of her.  “Hold perfectly still.”

From this distance, you can see that she is a bit shorter than you, at least in terms of her humanoid frame, but she can still tower over you when she uses her back legs to lift herself up.  She does just that as she casts an appraising eye over your naked body.

“Yes… you’ll make a lovely toy…” she says, leaning her face in close.  You don’t resist as her lips meet yours and you share a long, greedy kiss with her.

“Oh… I can do much more than be a toy,” you say with a smirk when she pulls away.

She smirks as well.  “Maybe so… but a toy is all I want you for.”

And then everything becomes a blur.  You feel her tackle you to the ground.  You feel your wrists get snagged by silk, then your arms forced behind your back.  The ground pulls away from your legs as your body spins round and round, faster than your mind can keep up with.  A glob of silk forced over your lips, and a taut cocoon woven expertly around your naked form.  By the time she lets you go, webbing has covered your figure from the tips of your feet to just below the nose, leaving you completely bound and entirely at her mercy.

Fear fills your eyes as you realize she never had any intention of negotiating.  She just chuckles and gives you an affectionate squeeze on the butt, before hoisting your wiggling body up and slinging it over a shoulder.

Then with a graceful leap, she slings back towards the cliff face, her new package in tow.

It had started as a tiny ember of desire, but as you walked it has grown and grown, until it’s fully progressed into a raging inferno.  You can’t hold it back any longer - your needs simply must be satisfied!

Luckily, Revissa seems just as on board with the plan as you are.  Her clothes come off just as quickly, her breath hot and heavy as you press your naked body down on top of her.

“The pollen… from earlier,” she murmurs, speaking of the flower that had sprayed the two of you at the entrance of the forest.  “I think it must have had… some kind of aphrodisiac quality to it.”

Her words serve as an explanation, but not a solution.  But mostly they just serve as a distraction from you getting what you want, so you solve the problem by covering her lips with your own.

She makes no protest as your bodies become one, your cries of euphoria echoing between the forest trees.  It is a moment of pure passion, of deepest desires fulfilled, of raw ecstasy, of absolute pleasure, and the two of you lose yourselves in each other’s embrace for what feels like hours.  But eventually, the effect of the pollen begins to wear off, allowing your senses to return - which is when Revissa notices something amiss.

“We’re being watched,” she says.

You humor her by looking around, but all you see is more forest.  But from the way she’s suddenly become tense, you can tell this isn’t something she’s just going to drop.  Which means, regrettably, no post love-making cuddles in your immediate future.

“There!” she says, pointing at a neary tree.

You raise an eyebrow.  As far as you can tell, there isn’t anything unusual about it.

“Ugh, you wouldn’t understand.  But I can tell that it’s watching us.  And I’m going to ask it what it wants.”

A hoarse, craggly voice suddenly cuts through the quiet of the forest, as apertures open in the tree’s bark in rough approximation of eyes and a mouth.  “No need to ask,” the tree says.  “Besides… I’ve already gotten what I want.  What a lovely show that was.  I haven’t seen such passion in years!”

You’re not prone to embarrassment, but your cheeks still color at the realization someone had been watching your raunchy love-making session.  You cough awkwardly, then glance towards Revissa, who seems just as tense as ever, even though her mysterious audience has been revealed.

    After the incident with the fae, Revissa seems less upset with you than she had been previously over getting lost.  It’s entirely possible the mysterious trickster had a hand in it.  At the very least, you’re not entirely to blame.  Though it doesn’t change the fact you still have no idea where to go.  This time, however, you and Revissa work together as a team to try and pick your way though, with you keeping an eye glued to your comm’s map display while she picks out signs from the natural world around you.
](else-if: $predstory is true)[
    Armed with the knowledge from Revissa’s story, you push forward even more stubbornly than before, heading in the direction you think to be north, even when the map on your comm tells you that you’ve been turned around.  If there’s some kind of psychic monster trying to trip you up, you’re not going going to give it the time of day.  Eventually you stop looking at the map entirely, relying on nothing more than your innate sense of direction to help you advance.
](else-if: $faewin is true)[
    You’re not going to back out now - not after you fought so hard against the mysterious trickster to get this far.   And so, you lead Revissa deeper into the woods, trying your best to navigate towards the destination on your map.  But once again, try as you might, the readings you are viewing on the comm screen and the surroundings you see with your eyes don’t add up.  Is that woman still messing with you?  Or is there something else in this forest trying to misdirect you.  That thought weighs heavily on your mind as you keep stubbornly pushing forward.
](else: )[
    Revissa is obviously annoyed at you for ignoring her perfectly reasonable solution to the problem, but she doesn’t protest all that much.  Maybe just because she realizes your pride has been wounded.  She’s mature enough to let *you* be immature without much fuss.  Which… only makes you feel more frustrated, which in turn makes you push forward all the more brazenly.  You really want to prove to her you know what you’re doing.
]
Unfortunately, after another hour, you still haven’t made any progress.  Nothing you do seems to work, almost as if the forest itself has willed itself to resist understanding.  Your annoyance grows, and a voice in the back of your head says you need to stop and reassess the situation, but you tell yourself you’ll pause after you circle around the next thich tangle of trees.

Which is when you feel the ground give out from beneath you.  A sickening *splort* fills your ears as your feet sink into the earth, your legs suddenly enmeshed in gooey, viscous liquid.  Looking around, you find that somehow you have walked right into the center of a pit of sticky black tar, laying in a pool smack dab in the middle of a wide clearing.  How you got that far into it before you started sinking defies explanation, but the fact remains that you are here.

“Ack… what is this stuff!” Revissa yells, stuck right alongside you.

Maybe sticking close together wasn’t such a good call, because now both you and your wife find yourselves buried past your shins in gooey tar.  Trying to lift your legs only results in the sticky mire snapping you back down in place, making you sink down even further.  

“I think I’m stuck…” you murmur, your strength useless in pulling you free.  You turn to Revissa.  “What about you?  Can you think of any magic that can help”

“Maybe if I transform into a bird, I can flutter out of here,” your wife suggests.  “Then I can find something to help you.”

You nod in agreement at the plan, even as the suction from the swamp pulls you down past the knees.  Revissa closes her eyes, raising her staff as high as she can while chanting the spell to change her form.  But then… something beneath you reacts.  An unnatural suction force tugs powerfully at your bodies, ripping her staff from her hands and drawing it deep into the muck beneath you.  Both of your clothes are taken with it, as you sink all the way down to your waists.

“What the heck was that?” you yell.

“I… don’t know,” Revissa says grimly.  “This must be something more than a mere swamp.  It has… a consciousness to it, a willpower.  And… it wants us inside of it.”

Well that’s not good news.  Looking around, you find that the wave of suction pulled loose an overhanging vine from a nearby tree, giving you something to hold on to.  You motion for Revissa to grab onto your arm as you tug… but then, as the end of the vine falls into the mire, that same suction force pulls down and snaps it apart.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="105" name="FD03" tags="" position="1875,1200" size="100,100">“Forget it!” you snap irritably.  “It’s clearly impossible!  Maybe it’s… magical, or cursed, or something!”

Revissa raises an eyebrow.  “Well, asking the plants would confirm it, if that’s what you think.”

You wave her away.  You don’t want to talk to any plants.  You just want to double back and start over, maybe pick a different path this time.  Clearly this one isn’t working out.  Revissa simply shrugs in resignation, following after you as you try to retrace your steps.

A tense half hour passes as you try to return to the spot where you started, and, interestingly, when moving away from the forest’s center you actually seem able to maintain your bearings.  Almost as if there really *was* something supernatural at play confounding your navigation.  Revissa eventually chimes in with a thought.

“Actually… I’ve heard about something similar to this before.  During my time in the Bolg Resistance, some guerrillas that specialized in deep forest missions would report getting lost - even in locations they should have known like the back of their hands.  It turned out there was some kind of predator that sent out a sort of … psychic pulse that confused their pathfinding skills and led them into traps.  Maybe there’s something similar happening here as well.”

You consider that information thoughtfully.  On the one hand, if that’s what’s going on here, it would exonerate your lack of directional awareness - so long as you found some way to overcome it.  On the other, at this point you’ve been wandering aimlessly for hours, so it might just be best to cut your losses.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="106" name="FD04" tags="" position="2075,1400" size="100,100">You pout and you fume, but eventually you have no choice but to admit that Revissa is right.  Unfortunately, all you’ve managed to accomplish in the past hour is prove your wilderness skills are not up to stuff - aided by modern technology or not.  Deflated, you nod and ask her to go through with the ritual.

Revissa smiles in that infuriating way where she is pretending not to be pleased with this development, but quite obviously is.  Which on the surface suggests she is trying to preserve your wounded pride, but in truth is an even more subtle jab at your ego, because she *knows* you know what she is thinking, and she *knows* you’d be much less ticked off if she gloated about being right rather than just letting you stew in your own failure.

Love is… complicated in that way.  Because it doesn’t make you angry.  It just makes you start thinking about how you might get back at her later.  An effort you know is futile, since any time you start a feud Revissa ends up winning it - for no better reason than she knows you’re hornier than she is, so the denial of sex is always an ultimatum that you have no choice but to surrender to.  To be honest, that’s part of what makes you love her so much.  There’s something incredibly sexy about a woman who can play you like a fiddle.

Either way, now that the die has been cast, all you can do is plop down on the floor and watch as she performs her signature nature magic, closing her eyes and spinning her staff to tap into the leylines of nature flowing all around her.  It’s not something you can see with your eyes, but your senses are sharp enough that you can still pick up on the changes around you - a susurrus of animal noises, a sharp pang of earthy aroma filling your nostrils, a sort of energy in the air that makes the fur of your tail bristle.  When she is done, she directs that nature energy towards a nearby tree, causing the rough bark on its surface to shift into the shape of a vaguely humanoid face.  

As it slowly opens its eyes, Revissa bows respectfully and delivers a traditional greeting in some ancient druidic tongue.

    You look desperately towards the edge of the tar pit.  There’s not anyone nearby that you can see, but you can’t think of anything else that will get you out of this.

“Help!” you shout above the sound of bubbling goop.  “Anyone!”

Your voice echoes between the trees, unanswered.  But you *know* there’s someone out there.  Watching, waiting.  And so, as your body sinks lower with another sickening *splort*, you try again.

“I know you can hear me!” you say.  “And I know you can help.”

Revissa glares at you.  “No, absolutely not.  We’re not getting tangled up with any fae.”

“What other choice do we have?” you plead.  “It’s that or sink.”

“Then we should sink,” she says firmly.

Another tug from the mire, and your arms get sucked under, leaving the two of you submerged halfway past the chest.  At this point there’s no way you’re escaping under your own power.  But maybe Revissa’s right - better the devil you know, as the saying goes.

Now buried halfway past your chests, you are unable to work up the strength to free your limbs against the powerful grip of the mire.

At this point, there’s nothing left you can do but

    If life gives you lemons, you make lemonade, and if a tar pit gives you a broken vine, you turn it into a lasso.  Moving quickly, you fashion the leafy rope into a serviceable snare, creating a loop that you’re hopeful will be sturdy enough to support your weight.  You know you’re working against time, and you can feel your body dipping further and further into the sludge, but finally, you think you’re ready to give it a toss.

But there’s one problem - you don’t see anywhere nearby to anchor it.  The vine simply isn’t long enough to catch onto any of the trees outside of the pit… which makes you wonder how it even ended up here in the first place.  Maybe Revissa’s right - there’s some kind of consciousness associated with this swamp, and it has a cruel sense of humor.

And that’s when it hits you.  What was it she had said - the predator she was talking about could disrupt the senses, make you believe something that wasn’t actually real.  Well, nothing about this swamp makes any sense.  You somehow fell right into its center while walking, never noticing the edges.  A vine dropped down from nowhere, even though there wasn’t a nearby tree for it to hang from.  The forest itself has been defying your every effort to keep track of where you were going.  Nothing about this is natural.  So maybe… the solution you need to escape is equally unnatural.

    Thinking fast, you come to a grim realization.  Other than your physical strength, you don’t have many tools available to help you out of this, and that strength has already failed you.  But Revissa knows magic, can transform into animals, can do all kinds of things.  If only one of you makes it out of this pit, it ought to be her.

And so, you wrap your arms around her waist and start hoisting upwards, causing the equal and opposite reaction of making you sink more deeply.  Now down halfway past your waist, with your arms totally submerged, there’s no way you’re going to be climbing out under your own power.

“Melfy, what are you doing?” your wife asks.

“Getting you out of here.  Just close your eyes and concentrate.  Even without your staff, you should be able to turn yourself into a tiny bird or something.  Once you get clear, you can think of something else – or at least make it back to the ship without me…”

There is a long silence… followed by a sudden moment of realization from your partner.  She seems to be distracted by something – something other than your heroic sacrifice.  Has she figured something out?

“Don’t always believe everything you see or hear…” she mutters.  

Those were the fae woman’s parting words.  You’d think Revissa of all people would be suspicious of what she had told you, but in her eyes you see a flicker of understanding.

“Melfy… you trust me?” she asks.

“Of course.”  

“Then close your eyes, and take my hand.  Concentrate on nothing other than the sound of my voice.”

You do as you’re told.  It’s obvious she’s onto something here.  You close your eyes, and you try to ignore the feeling of the muck pulling against your body, of the fact that you’re slowly sinking, that in a few moments your head will be beneath the surface of the inky swamp.  All you do is listen, and wait.

“And now… stand up.”

If it were anyone else telling you to do that when you were in the middle of a tar pit, you’d have told them they were crazy.  But you trust your wife.  You trust her more than yourself, more than even your own senses.  And so, despite the absurdity, you bend your knees, you push upwards… and you stand straight and tall.

Before you have a chance to process what is happening, she clutches her fingers around your wrist and begins to walk forward.  So you follow her. Moving through what should have been impossibly thick tar, but finding it as easy as if you were taking a morning jog.

Your lips are eternally locked with Revissa’s, the two of you given the opportunity to kiss each other to your heart’s content, and to grind against each other whenever you’re horny.  With webbing imbued with the planet’s ghost matter, you never need to eat or sleep, and you won’t even grow any older.  You’ll get to enjoy the loving ministrations of your owner every day, who always keeps you entertained and stimulated.  What more could you ask for in life?  No more scraping by for enough credits to pay for repairs, no more risking your life on dangerous missions.

To be perfectly honest, you would have been happy here forever.  You had no intention of escaping.  But the Star Scout rescue beacon you swallowed earlier had other thoughts on the matter.  Thanks to the beacon, your crew was able to track you down, and though they couldn’t manage to save you directly, they did negotiate your freedom with the spider women in exchange for all the information they had gathered on the planet so far.  Sadly, that included giving over the data collection devices, meaning your mission was a failure.  But at least you have your freedom.

Though for the rest of your life, you’ll always wonder if you might have enjoyed things more being a pet…

As embarrassing as it is to admit, your best choice is to make a run for it.  Once you’ve put some distance between them, maybe you can find a way to sneak up on them and regain the advantage.

It’s not the best plan, but it’s the only one you’ve got.  Leaving your rest spot behind, you rush into the trees, not even bothering to look back as you plunge recklessly into the forest.  Right now, the most important thing is to just not get caught yourself.  Only once you’re sure you’re safe can you figure out where to go from there.

You duck under branches, leap through bushes, and barrel past confused wildlife, making a lot of noise, but hopefully going fast enough that your pursuer won’t be able to follow.  Though, after a while, you slow your steps and proceed with more caution, doing your best to cover your tracks and thoroughly give the spider-lady the slip.  In the back of your mind, you realize in your haste you’ve also completely lost your bearings, meaning that getting back to where Revissa was is going to be a huge pain.  Luckily, you still have the map on your comm device - though there’s no guarantee those ladies will still be there, even if you do manage to find it again.

Speaking of your map, as you glance at it, you notice something disconcerting… namely, that your position doesn’t seem to be correctly updating.  Or rather, that something might be interfering with it.  All at once, your memories from your previous attempt at making it through the forest come rushing back in, of the strange predator that confused and disoriented you, tried to lead you into an imaginary tar pit.  Could it be that you’ve run so far and so quickly that you’ve stumbled back into its territory?

Your heart beats faster as your mind races to consider your options.  This could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it.  On the one hand, you’re doubling the number of creatures trying to capture you now.  But on the other hand… your spidery pursuer might fall into the same trap that you did earlier, only she wouldn’t know how to escape it.

Then you just need to retrace your steps, find Revissa, and save her from the second lady who’s gotten her all wrapped up.  What could go wrong?

And so, you slow your movements, trying to make yourself obvious as you plunge further and further towards the middle of the forest.  And eventually you’re rewarded by the sound of skittering from the branches above you.  She’s here!

“Phew… you gave me quite the workout,” she says cheerily, dropping down from a branch above you.

You’d like to say you put up a good fight.  That knowing you had a plan, your confidence allowed you to pull out some kind of amazing distraction that enabled you to escape.  But of course, that doesn’t happen.

Less than a minute after appearing, the spider lady has you striped, bound, gagged, and totally at her mercy.  So much for having a plan.  In the end, it seems like there was nothing you could have ever done to escape your fate.

And yet… after she finishes wrapping you up, the spider-babe seems to get distracted.  She looks around wildly, eyes filled with fear, before stepping away.  You’re not sure what she sees, what memory was pulled from her mind.  All you know is that suddenly she freezes in place, holding perfectly still, hardly even breathing.  And then… she slowly lays down, curls up into a ball, and closes her eyes.

Could it be… has she fallen victim to the same predator who had tricked you into thinking you were sinking?  You wriggle about helplessly in your webs, unable to get closer to inspect the situation.  All you can do is watch as something emerges from the woods.  

This must be it!  The creature that tormented your mind.  The monster that controls the entire central expanse of these woods.  A predator who snags its prey without ever lifting a finger, defeating them with such overwhelming power they never even have the *chance* to put up a fight.  And as it comes into view, you can see that it’s…]

…a bunny?

Sure enough, an adorable woodland creature, with bright green and gold fur, cautiously hops out and pokes the inert spider-gal with its adorable twitchy nose.  Once it confirms she’s incapacitated, it hops up on top of her, curls up and… falls asleep?

Well then.  It looks like the fearsome predator trapping you in its mental prison was actually just an adorable bunny that wanted someplace cozy to take a nap.  Though… you get the feeling, as cute as it is, it had no intention of letting you go if it had actually managed to catch you.  But all things considered… this is probably the most adorable way to get trapped in the forest.

Part of the reason you escaped the swamp trap was because Revissa was with you.  Without her, how could you possibly find the courage and strength to defy your own senses?  

No… it would be too dangerous.  Instead, you start to double back, looking towards your map to see when it starts making sense again.  Unfortunately, you pay a bit too much attention to that, and not to your surroundings.  So you don’t realize you’re being watched until the sudden pressure on the back of your head, and a hand pulling you forward so that your lips meet a woman’s tender kiss.

“Mmmph?”

Opening your eyes, you see the spider lady who was chasing you suspended upside down on a length of webbing.  Instantly, you try to pull away, but several globs of webbing rain down to restrain your ankles and wrists against the tree behind you.  This gives her the chance to enjoy every instant of her long, passionate kiss, saliva dripping from her mouth as she finally pulls away.

You look up at her with terror and confusion, but she just smiles and pokes your nose.

“I figured you deserved a little reward for giving me such a good workout,” she says brightly.  “But now, let’s get you wrapped up and back together with your cute little friend.”

Stuck and exhausted, you are unable to put up anything even resembling a fight.  A slash from the sharp point of one of her back legs cuts away your clothing, then a gentle spin from her humanoid arms sends you whirling round and round as the silk emerging from her body coils you up nice and tight.  Soon you’re bundled up completely, from the feet to just below the nose, bound, gagged, and totally at your pursuer’s mercy.

As you go, you see more slumbering forms scattered about, trapped in the bunny’s mental labyrinth.  Mostly woodland creatures, though there’s a couple humanoids scattered about - a pair of knotties, probably women from the camp who got themselves lost.  You decide not to risk waking them, lest you arouse the fear of the mighty green rabbit.  Though you notice nestled in the arms of the sleeping women are some brightly colored eggs, suggesting they might be contributing to the circle of life by incubating the critter’s descendants.

Either way, you make your way back to where you and Revissa were separated, using your map once the bunny’s psychic distortions allow you to follow it properly.  Eventually you see the cliff face towering above you, and carefully creep up it, trying not to disturb the second gorgeous spider-babe who might be lurking in wait.

You don’t find her – but you do find something else.

Revissa looks up at you fearfully, wriggling ineffectively in a tight silk cocoon.  Not just bound up, but also anchored to the floor and to a rock from an overhanging portion of the cliff up above.  Her lips are sealed, but her breasts are exposed, indicating her captor must have spent some time having fun with her before leaving.

You can’t help yourself, and give her inviting pair a firm squeeze.  It’s so rare that Revissa is the one in need of rescuing and not you.  She rolls her eyes and strains against her bindings, just making her chest bounce all the more obviously.  

“Hold still now,” you say with a chuckle, taking out the runic knife to cut her free.

A few minutes later, Revissa is parted from the silk, and has reclaimed the clothing and gear the spider lady had taken from her.  She explains that her captor had stuck by her for a few hours when her sister had run off into the forest in pursuit of you, but when her fellow arachnid did not return she eventually went searching for her.  It’s just pure dumb luck that the two of you didn’t meet up on your way back, or she probably would have caught you as easily as her sister did.

Either way, it seems like against all odds you’ve managed to escape capture - thanks to the help of an unassuming forest critter.  Revissa hardly believes your story about the bunny as you both continue following the cliff path towards the deepest part of the forest, unmolested by the second spider sister, at least for the time being.

You and Revissa now find yourselves in the heart of the woods, with only a short trek to your destination remaining, if the map on your comm device is to be believed.

If this were a video game, you would expect this to be the part where the environment grew dark, twisted and foreboding as a boss battle loomed on the horizon, but as a pleasant surprise, the area ahead seems the most welcoming of all the places you’ve yet visited in the forest.  You appear to have arrived at a natural grove of fruit trees, tightly clustered together in this one particular region.  Revissa gives you a complicated explanation for why you hadn’t encountered the fruit trees elsewhere in the forest, taking into account elevation, light levels, soil fertility, and the migration patterns of birds depositing the seeds, but it rather goes over your head.

Instead you just pick up a stray fruit and take a lazy bite.  It’s an iridescent green color and is vaguely shaped like an apple, but has much softer, fleshier skin, giving way to an almost honey-like nectar as you eat.  Revissa sighs as some spills down your chin, chastising you not to eat random things off the ground from a weird grove in the middle of a ghost planet.  You respond by taking another bite.  It really is quite good.

Advisability of partaking of the delectable fruits aside, your map is telling you the data device needs to be set somewhere within the grove, so the two of you push further ahead.  (if: $treetalk is true)[But as you walk, your sharp ears pick up on a rustle coming from the branches up above.

Those spider-babes, sexy though they may be, are clearly too much of a threat.  You get the sense that an open confrontation with them would swiftly result in your and Revissa’s quick and decisive capture.  And though you may yearn for the softness of their silk against your skin, you decide to save that for private time with your wife’s spider-form when you get back to your quarters on the ship.

So, tail between your legs, you retreat.  You double back the way you came, trying to keep out of sight of the cliffs above, from whence an arachnid might pounce at any moment.  All things considered, you make good time, and soon your map tells you the entrance to the forest is within sight.  However, as you approach, your ears happen to catch the sound of something rustling nearby in the brush.  Revissa, standing beside you, hears it too.  The two of you exchange glances and then, as one, turn to face it.

The two of you proceed for several tense minutes, with Revissa constantly looking behind you for signs of pursuit, and you alternating between checking the map on your comm device and looking out over the horizon to try and pick out the direction towards your destination.  You feel pretty confident that you can get there, but will you be able to do it safely?  Only time will tell.

Either way, the path is ahead of you.  And soon you find yourself plunging into the very heart of the woods.

You and your wife have both gone through so much, endured countless adventures, both together and on your own.  And because of that, your instincts have been honed to a razor sharp edge, letting you pick up on danger where other women would have continued unawares.

Usually, that experience is a good thing.  Normally, reacting quickly can save your life.  Sadly, this time, it proves to have the opposite effect.  Because as the two of you wheel around in unison, you find yourselves looking right into the eyes of a large, squat, bulky lizard with vibrant scales the same pastiche of colors as the leaves crumpled up on the ground.  

That trained mind of yours, honed by years of instinct, warns you of the threat you now face a micro-second before your body begins to seize up.  You have just enough time to begin to swivel, for your eyes to widen, for your lips to part and for a warning to begin to form on your tongue.  Revissa reacts even faster, holding a hand out in front of her, as if that, somehow, could stop what was about to happen.

What you’ve discovered, creeping up on you in the brush, is a basilisk.  A creature known for its ability to turn flesh to stone as soon as one meets its gaze.  In a universe where you were less perceptive, you might have been better off.  But that’s not the universe you and your wife currently occupy.

Given how many adventures you and your wife have made it through, it’s a rather ignominious way to end this one.  But as your clothing turns brittle and crumples away, and your mind falls into a deep, dreamless sleep, you realize with your last gasp of consciousness that life is not always fair.  The greatest of stories can end in a heartbeat with one mistimed step.  And it seems yours has met just such an unsatisfying conclusion.

But as you leave your hiding place, you explain that if it was your pursuers, then even laying eyes on them might have been a fatal misstep - since then they, in turn, could lay eyes on you.  And you don’t have any confidence you’d be able to give them the slip if they caught your trail a second time.

Either way, it seems that you’re free to continue back to the start and pick up your journey once more.

She seems to be searching, prowling - hunting for the two of you, unwilling to give up the chase.  But she doesn&#39;t know exactly where you are.  With a frenzied hand motion, you direct Revissa to follow you as you shimmy as quietly as you can inside of a hollowed out log, clutching each other tightly as you press against the rotting bark.

Through a gap in the wood, you can see the spider-woman seemingly catch the scent of something, prompting her to leap into the air, swing along a silken tether, then pounce behind a nearby rock.  But instead of a pair of lovely adventurers, she just surprises some local wildlife.  It lets out a guttural growl, but then retreats into the brush, fleeing from the sudden intrusion.

“Hmmph,” your pursuer says with an honestly quite adorable pout.  “I was so sure they were here…”

She lingers around for a while longer, but eventually leaves without any prey.  You and Revissa wait a good ten minutes after she is out of sight, holding your breath, sweat dripping down your brows, but she does not seem to be circling back.  And so, carefully, quietly, you climb out from your hiding place, and continue your retreat back to the forest entrance.  Hopefully you’ll have better luck on one of the other routes.

You have no confidence you’d be able to escape again if they spotted you.  And so you wrap your arms around your wife and hold her tight as you try to make yourselves as small and quiet as possible.  For several tense moments you stay there, trying to still your breathing, to will yourselves out of existence entirely.

There is the briefest of moments where you think it worked.  But then comes the shadow from above, the spider-woman propelled on a line of silk swinging herself from a tree branch.  She tackles you both to the ground at once, and in the same movement sprays you both with more silk than you could possibly handle.  By the time you come to your senses, you’re already completely restrained, already at the arachnid’s mercy as the sharp points at the end of her back legs begin making short work of your clothing.

“Gotcha!” she purrs dreamily, tossing each of you other a shoulder, totally cocooned, kicking and screaming fruitlessly into silk gags woven over your lips.  

And just like that, you’re captured.  With no choice in the matter, she brings you back towards the cliffs where she makes her home.

“Melfy, I–” your wife begins.  

But you cut her off with a kiss.  It’s impossible to fight the suction of the tar-filled mire enough to break through the surface, but you still have enough strength to find her body within the muck and pull it in close.  When your lips part, you’re both up to your necks.

“Whatever happens next… we’ll be together,” you say quietly.

She sniffles and nods.  “Together…” she agrees.

And so you press your foreheads against one another and close your eyes, as with one final *splort*, you sink completely.  

All around you can hear nothing but the incessant churning of the mire, can see nothing through the thick, all-encompassing tar.  You hold Revissa as tight as you can, with even more urgency than holding your breath.  Your lungs give out before your arms.  

And yet… you don’t drown.  You gasp for air, feeling the tar slip down your throat, but then something seems to suddenly snap into place within your body, like a picture coming into focus.  After that, you don’t feel the need to breathe.

Thinking back to your briefing, you recall what was said about the planet’s ‘ghost matter’.  That so long as you were in contact with it, you would not need to eat or drink, would not even require air.  It seems like that is the case.  It means your lives aren’t about to end… but that’s *all* it means.

The sinking never seems to stop.  You keep falling, down, down down, further and further, feet never reaching a bottom.  Is it a trick of the mind?  Have you fallen into some kind of dimension of infinite sludge?  You have no way of knowing.  The one thing that drives you is the need to keep holding onto your wife, to make sure your bodies never part.  Because if you separated, you’d never find her again in this endlessly churning mire.

At this point, there’s no hope of finding a way out.  But at least you’ll suffer that fact together with the woman you love.

She sees the confidence in your eyes, and does as she is told.  You feel her wrap her arms around your waist, pulling herself in close, nuzzling her face against your shoulder.  It’s a nice feeling, a familiar feeling, and an empowering one too.  Knowing she trusts you enough not to ask questions gives you the self-assurance you need to fight against your own senses.

You close your eyes as well, scooping Revissa up in your arms.  Yes, you easily lift her in the air, as if there weren’t any sticky tar holding you down.  Because, you now realize, there *isn’t* any.  And then you start to walk, one foot in front of the other, ignoring the sounds of the supposed swamp surrounding you and the impossible grip of the tar.  None of this is real.  It’s all just some kind of mental confusion meant to keep you stuck in one place.  For what purpose, you can’t imagine, but it surely isn’t one that’s good for your health.

Navigating purely by belief, disregarding your brain’s perception of reality, you stomp forward, maintaining your momentum until you smack face-first into a tree.  At least it feels like you do, but that might be more diversion.  You keep walking, keep pushing forward, ignoring more attempts to distract you - the heat of flames and smell of smoke, the shuddering footsteps and hungry snarl of a vicious beast, the pleasant smell of perfume and coquettish giggle of a beautiful forest nymph, all of it.  Until, finally, the illusions stop.

You collapse to the ground in a heap with your wife, finally peeling open your eyes to find yourself in an entirely unassuming portion of the woods.  No tar pit, no fire, no monsters, and no lusty dryads (sadly).  It seems like you’ve escaped the lair of whatever creature was trying to trap you in its mental projections.  You never actually managed to lay eyes on it… but maybe that’s for the best.

Pulling out the map on your comm device, you find you’re halfway between your starting location and your destination.  At this point, you’re probably safe to keep heading forwards… but maybe it would be best to double back.  There’s no telling if the creature might try to trap you once more.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="129" name="FD02H" tags="" position="1925,1550" size="100,100">It defies explanation, but before you know it, you’ve escaped the clutches of the swamp.  By doing nothing more than walking out of it.  As if it weren’t there in the first place.  
(set: $swampescape to true)
After a few minutes of walking, letting your wife lead you, the two of you come to a stop, and she lets you know you can open your eyes again by brushing a hand against your cheek lightly.  

“What the heck was that?” you ask.  “What magic did you use to get us out of that swamp?”

“The swamp… was never there in the first place,” your wife explains.  “As we were sinking, I was reminded of something.  During my time in the Bolg Resistance, some guerrillas that specialized in deep forest missions would report getting lost - even in locations they should have known like the back of their hands.  It turned out there was some kind of predator that sent out a sort of … psychic pulse that confused their pathfinding skills and led them into traps.  I think that’s what was happening here.  According to their stories, the predator would try to incapacitate them in some way - usually by making them believe something that wasn’t true, like that they had fallen into a ravine and broken their leg.  The ones who bought the lie were never heard from again, but those who got out of it did so by noticing the inconsistencies about the situation and fighting against their own senses to escape.”

You scratch your head.  “You figured that out just from the words the fae woman said?  About not trusting your senses.”

“Well… more than that.  It’s when you tried to sacrifice yourself to save me that I felt it.  There was a brief moment where all I could think of was how much I loved you, and… in that instant, I suddenly felt like the tar was gone, that I could move normally.”

A blush creeps across your cheeks, but you mask the emotional moment with your usual confident swagger.  “So basically, it’s all thanks to me.”

Revissa kicks you in the shin with annoyance.  “Yeah, sure, completely negate the fact that I remembered something I heard offhand almost two decades ago that let me drag your blonde ass out of an inescapable situation.”

It’s these moments of banter that remind you why you love her so much.  You just respond by taking her hand and pulling her in for a long, passionate kiss.  As always, that smooths things over nicely.

“As always, you’re my light in the darkness,” you say as you pull away from her.  “Now, let’s get the hell out of here.”

Thanks to Revissa’s quick thinking, another perilous situation has been avoided.  First conniving fae, now strange psychic predators.  At this point, maybe it’s time to admit that you chose wrong when you first entered the forest.  Perhaps a different path would be more accommodating to your efforts.  Though you’ve already wasted enough time already.  After discussing it with your wife, she’s happy to leave the decision in your hands.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="130" name="FD06" tags="" position="2600,1275" size="100,100">You understand what Revissa is saying, you really do.  The fae are not to be trusted.  Any help they offer will only come back to bite you in the ass later.  But as the sticky mire pulls you up to the neck, you can’t accept this is as your fate.

So with an apologetic glance at your wife, you call out once again.

“Whoever you are, wherever you are, I’m sure you’re watching.  So… please, save us!  Get us out of here, and I’ll play whatever game you want from me.”

Despite your plea, you get no reply, other than the snapping and popping of bubbles, the relentless churning of the bottomless, goopy sludge.  Another tug and you sink up to your chin.  And with another, your nose drops below the surface.  The last thing you can do is make desperate eye contact with your wife before, with one final pull, your world becomes dark.  No more sky, no more trees, no more air, just an endlessly gyrating morass that subsumes all your senses.  

So this is it.  This is how your story ends - sunken and forgotten at the bottom of a tar pit in the middle of a cursed forest.  Not how you expected things to go, that’s for sure.  But then, just as gravity loses all meaning, as up and down become indistinguishable from left and right, something gives way, and you feel yourself landing on soft grass.  Your eyes shoot open and your lungs hungrily gulp down fresh air as you find yourself in the center of a very familiar clearing.

“So… you said you’d play a game with me?”

It’s impossible to tell when one day ends and another begins, when a month passes, a year.  Your life is in stasis, your body suspended on all sides by the infinite depths of tar.  Presumably, you find sleep, though with no other stimuli to keep you occupied, you’re not even sure when you’re awake and when you aren’t.  But Revissa remains a constant, the pressure of her body the one comfort you have in this endless nightmare.

For the first few days?  Weeks?  Years?  You’re not sure, but for a period of time, you hold on to a hope that someone will find you.  Your friends and crewmates would come looking for you, would try to figure out what had happened.  But for all you know, they get caught by something else.  Hell, they could have fallen into the same infinite sludge pit, could be sinking only inches away from the two of you, and you’d never know it.  Because there’s no way to communicate here - other than with the periodic pressure you and Revissa apply to each other’s bodies with your embrace.  So maybe if you reached out, you’d bump up against Vhaja, or Krysta, or someone else entirely.  There’s no way to know, and you’re not going to risk it.   Because at this point, Revissa is your whole world, is your only comfort, and you’re never going to let her go.  

In the end, eternity passes without a rescue.  But at least you never let go.  At least you’re not alone.  Despite your failure, that’s one small victory.

But Revissa remains a constant, the pressure of her body the one comfort you have in this endless nightmare.

But thankfully, this is a nightmare you eventually wake up from.  You remain ignorant of the fact you’re being rescued right up until you aren’t, when you suddenly find yourself suspended high in the air, together with various bits of rocks, leaves, and small woodland creatures.

You find out later that your friends managed to track you down thanks to the Star Scout homing beacon, but when they tried to mount a rescue, they could not pick their way through the forest.  So… they flew your spaceship above the location of your beacon and activated its tractor beam, dragging you and half a city block’s worth of forest into the cargo bay.

Curiously, there was no tar found in the hold, or on your bodies.  Was it all some kind of dream?  A hallucination?  You aren’t sure.  The one thing that you do know is that the rescue attempt destroyed your data collection devices, making the mission a resounding failure.  And so you are forced to leave the planet with your tail between your legs, wondering how things might have gone differently if you’d had a better sense of direction.

GAME OVER

[[Start Over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="133" name="FD02F" tags="" position="1775,1800" size="100,100">You’ve made it this far, you figure.  No sense backing down now.  And so, once you get your bearings straight, you begin to walk.  This time, it appears there’s nothing tripping you up, allowing you to make good time towards your destination.  You feel vindicated that your initial impression about the route was correct - this really was the shortest path, and you really could navigate through it, so long as nothing supernatural got in your way.  

Speaking of supernatural, just as you start to think you’re going to finish the journey uninterrupted, you do, in fact, get interrupted, by a coarse, scraggly voice coming from just past a nearby tree.

“Ho, traveler, stay a while, please, and heed my words,” it says.

You and Revissa stop as the voice addresses you, looking around in confusion for its source.

“Right here, friends.  Beside you.”

It is only then that you realize the voice was not coming from *past* the tree, but from *within* it.  Or rather, coming *from* it.  Because the tree in question appears to have a face carved into its wooden trunk, like one you might see on a jill-o-lantern.  

You blink a few times, glancing at Revissa in confusion, before finally responding.

“Uh… yes?  What can we help you with?”

“Ah, but it is I who I think can help you, travelers,” says the tree.  “These woods are dangerous, as I am sure you already know.  I can guide you to the safest path towards your goal, if you’d like.”


Finally!  Something friendly on this planet, you think to yourself.  You’re about to accept the help when you feel your wife lay a stern hand on your shoulder.

“Something seems wrong…” Revissa says, looking towards you but with eyes darting suspiciously towards the tree.

You raise an eyebrow.   “Aren’t you a nature-lover?  You should be the *first* person in the world to trust what a tree has to say.”

“Yes… but… ugh, I don’t know.  Something just seems wrong to me.  I can’t put my finger on it, but I’m getting bad vibes from this whole thing.”

Well, bad vibes or no, you still have a mission to do.  And after losing several hours to aimless wandering, you really should be getting back to it.

[[Accept the tree’s guidance-&gt;FD02FA]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="134" name="FD02G" tags="" position="1775,1925" size="100,100">It takes a big woman to admit when she’s wrong.  So in a way, maybe you’re actually doing a good job when you turn to Revissa and tell her that it’s best you abandon this path and return to the entrance of the forest.    You were… wrong, to pick this option.  You were wrong when you stubbornly pressed on, when you refused to admit you were lost, and when you decided to turn back and challenge the perception-altering predator that came so close to trapping you.  

In the end, it seems clear that this path cutting through the center of the forest was a mistake.  Better to double back and try a different route entirely.

Revissa seems… frustrated at your indecisiveness, but agrees that she’d really rather not have to contend with all those illusions, or whatever they were, again.  And so she walks alongside you as you retrace your steps, heading back the way you came.  Thankfully, the map on your comm device appears to be accurate, keeping careful note of your reverse-progress as you near the place where you started.  

However, as you are looking down to confirm the readings, you happen to notice the sound of rustling coming from the bushes nearby.  Revissa, standing beside you, hears it too.  The two of you exchange glances and then, as one, turn to face it.

If she thinks there’s something fishy here, she’s probably right.  But on the other hand, you can’t just turn down the chance to speed things along, especially after wasting so much time.  Vhaja is counting on you to install these data devices.

“Alright… please show us the way,” you ask to the tree.

Revissa gives you a disapproving look.  You shrug your shoulders apologetically.

“Very well…” says the tree, in its creaking, wooden voice.  “All you need do is follow the sound of my voice.  This portion of the forest can be quite perilous.  Strange monsters roam, waiting to claim unlucky travelers for their own.”

You know that all too well, given your previous encounter with whatever trapped you in that fake swamp.  Escaping that was only possible with boundless confidence, you recall, and so, you maintain that confidence as you unwaveringly accept the tree’s advice.  Revissa rolls her eyes at you, but you maintain a bounce in your step as you head out into the forest once again.  It helpfully warns you when there is danger nearby, speaking of a nest of territorial spiders, of a prowling basilisk, and of a sap-spitting plant that would have loved to wrap you up in its leaves. Before long, you find yourself entering the very deepest part of the woods, a short distance from your destination.

The mission is obviously important, but *because* it’s important you need to avoid walking yourself into any traps that might trip you up.

And that’s when you realize it.  Who’s to say this isn’t yet another, even more elaborate lure from the predator you had escaped earlier?  You’d thought you’d moved past the radius of its influence, but perhaps its reach extends further than you thought.  Or maybe this is another one of its kind, or any of a million other possibilities.  At this point truth and fiction have become so blurred, you’re not sure if *anything* can be trusted.  Other than Revissa.

“Let’s go,” you say, taking her hand and leading her away.  “You’re right, this is probably just another trick.”

She pauses a moment, then nods, allowing you to guide her.  Like before, she closes her eyes and leaves everything to you.

“Wait – no, come back!” yells the tree.  “I promise I’m not the critter who was trying to catch you before.  I can help you, really!  I’m –”

But the tree’s voice has already faded away as you cut through the woods.

Once you’ve put enough distance between you, you check your map once again, and find you’re nearly at your destination.  Though now you’re wondering if this is yet more misdirection.  Maybe you only *think* you’re not lost… is there any way to tell for sure?

It is as you are so deep in thought that you hear a rustle come from the bushes beside you.  Revissa, standing beside you, hears it too.  The two of you exchange glances and then, as one, start to turn to face it.

Revissa glances up at the spot, just in time to spy the string of spider silk arcing out from between the branches.  It strikes you right in the chest, glomming on tightly, then pulls backwards, lifting you off your feet and high into the air.  The world becomes a blur, your mind unable to keep up with the suddenness of your abduction, leaving you disoriented well before your body slams into the side of a tree.

And then your attacker is upon you.  By the time you manage to get a glimpse of her face, she’s already pinned you beneath her body and bound your wrists and ankles together to prevent any attempt at struggle.

And then your world becomes as a blur as you spin round and round in her grip, unable to put up a fight as she weaves a taut, inescapable cocoon around your helpless form.  

If nothing else, you have to marvel at her efficiency.  From alert and aware to overwhelmingly helpless in less than a minute flat - a new record, as far as kidnappings go.  And that does seem to be her plan.  Once she’s done bundling you up, she scoops you into her arms and slings you over a shoulder, using lines of webbing to sling herself between the trees and off towards the line of cliffs to the west that ring the forest area.  

You make some token wiggles and squirms, grunting into your gag, but she holds on with a vice-like grip, preventing you from even the most rudimentary hope of escape.  Before long, she has reached her destination, ducking into a cave opening hidden in the cliffs with her new prize in tow.

Given everything else that’s happened so far, you’re pleased to find that the trip into the grove is uneventful.  Your holographic map narrows down the location to an area only a few feet wide, which you reach without incident.  The data device syncs with your comm and begins to hum as you get close, letting you know it is time to remove it from your pack and set it down on the ground.  It sends out a scanner pulse then starts to hover in the air, before turning itself intangible as it aligns with the spectral frequencies of the ambient environment (not that any of those words mean much to you).

And just like that, you’ve completed one of your objectives!  Getting here was certainly not a walk in the park, but happily the actual task proved to be relatively simple.  If only all your jobs could be this easy!

Too late do you realize the error in thinking such a thing.  After all the adventures you’d been on in your life, you should know better than to think anything would ever be easy.  If something is seeming to go smoothly, it just means you are moments away from a complication that will throw everything up now out of balance.

Luckily, the complication this time is quite easy on the eyes.

Revissa’s keen awareness picks up on it first - a change in the texture of the air, a nervousness in the minds of nearby prey animals, a flicker of shadow from a nearby cliff face.  A word of warning from your partner sets you on edge, and your own keen eyes pick out the threat just as it skitters down in front of you, maybe fifty feet away from where you’re standing.

It’s not the bravest decision, but it’s the most responsible one.  At least, that’s what you tell yourself as you turn around and head back the way you came.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="142" name="FD09E" tags="" position="2775,2550" size="100,100">After everything you’ve been through thus far, you’re not going to back down now.  Be it through strength, wisdom, dedication, or just plain luck, you’ve managed to overcome everything that’s come your way thus far.  So what’s a bit more?

Sure, the forest has been trying to trip you up, lead you astray, divert your attention, but now you’ve learned much more about it.  And so you’re not going to let it scare you from continuing.  With newfound courage, you press forward, heading in the direction you think you need to go without paying too much attention to the map, or even to your own senses.  Eyes and ears can be fooled, but not the heart.  Or at least, so you hope.

Against all odds, you appear to be right.  Now that you know what it was that was getting you lost, you find yourself able to compensate, navigating the treacherous tangle of trees until you make it far enough that your comm device starts working again, having escaped the influence of whatever was fooling your senses.

But even as you are preoccupied with that minor victory,  you hear it - the telltale rustling of bushes off to your side.  Revissa notices it as well, and as one, the two of you turn to face it.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="143" name="FD03A" tags="" position="2025,1200" size="100,100">“So once they realized what was happening, what did the resistance members do to avoid the predator?” you ask.

“Well, the way it worked was, once they were lost and separated from their friends, the predator would try to incapacitate them in some way - usually by making them believe something that wasn’t true, like that they had fallen into a ravine and broken their leg.  After that, well - we don’t know what happened to people who it dragged off, but from people that survived, they got out of it by noticing the inconsistencies about the situation and fighting against their own senses to escape.”

You puff your chest out proudly.  “So basically, what I need to do is be even *more* confident that I’m right, and ignore any information to the contrary, even from my own senses.”

“I mean… yeah.  I guess?” Revissa says lamely.  “But I feel like you’re learning the wrong lesson here.”

“Nope!  The solution is to be an intolerable ass and never listen to anyone else.”

Revissa rolls her eyes and kicks you hard in the shin.  You just flash her your most winning smile as you turn around and again head into the center of the forest.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="144" name="FD03B" tags="" position="2150,1200" size="100,100">You’re done with this stupid section of forest.  One can only get lost and disoriented so many times before deciding to try a different path.  

“Let’s just head back.  We’ve wasted too much time already.”

Revissa seems disappointed that you’re not interested in making use of her idea, but knows better than to start an argument over it.  And so, you begin tromping back through the forest, thankfully finding no further directional mishaps along the way.  Before long, you can see the edge of the trees in front of you, indicating you’ve fully doubled back after hours of delay.

Now all you need to do is get your bearings once more, and then you can try out a different road.  However, as you are cross-referencing your position with the map on your comm, you happen to notice the sound of rustling coming from the bushes nearby.  Revissa, standing beside you, hears it too.  The two of you exchange glances and then, as one, turn to face it.

[[Lay your eyes on the threat-&gt;FA05]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="145" name="FD04A" tags="" position="2225,1400" size="100,100">Your eyes sag as Revissa does her nature thing.  The tree doesn’t seem to speak back to her in any way you can comprehend, but your wife still seems to be making sense of things nonetheless, perhaps noticing the patterns of grass swaying in the breeze, or the motion of leaves as they gently drift down from the branches above.  It’s all rather… boring, if you’re being honest.  Impressive, to be sure - you’ve never had a knack for magic, arcane, animistic, or otherwise, so you’re sure everything Revissa is doing takes concentration and talent.  But it doesn’t change the fact that it’s not particularly engrossing to watch.

Which is why your eyes mostly just drift towards Revissa’s shapely posterior, and the adorable little deer tail poking out from beneath her skirt.  Back and forth, back and forth, it flicks charmingly as she communes.  Though… after a short while, it suddenly holds perfectly still and tense.

Raising an eyebrow in confusion, you look towards your wife’s face, and see telltale signs of worry etched into her features.  Not necessarily scared, but… cautious.  

“Something wrong?” you ask.

It takes a few long moments before she responds.

“I… am not talking to a tree,” she eventually says.

You just kind of stare at her with a confused look on her face.  She sighs irritably.

“It’s… oh, you wouldn’t understand.  But it’s not how a tree would normally talk.”  She turns and glares at the face in the bark.  “It is… some kind of fey spirit, I have to assume.  A trickster, playing a bit of a joke.  Making me think it’s a tree as a jape.”

Now the caution in her posture makes sense.  You haven’t really had much dealing with the fair folk - not exactly your department.  Vhaja has before, you know, together with an unlikely companion she had made, the half-fey daughter of the Winter Queen.  And you’re pretty sure Revissa has spoken about making deals with fairykind during her days in the Bolg Resistance.  But you’ve been fortunate enough to avoid that realm up until now, though even you know that fae are fickle, capricious, and potentially very dangerous

“How delightfully droll,” comes a voice.  It’s sharp and gravely, and appears to be emanating from the ‘mouth’ of the tree-face.  “Figured it out so soon, did you?”

Revissa narrows her eyes.  “I’m not so easily tricked, I’m sorry to say.”

Suddenly, there is a rush of sound, like sparkling firecrackers popping all around you, then a flash of motion as the leaves behind Revissa’s feet swirl in a multi-colored vortex.  You back away instinctively, reaching towards your sword, watching as a figure emerges from the storm and claps its hands.

A figure that… is oddly familiar.

You recognize the gorgeous woman standing in front of you now.  In fact, you were just thinking about her.  Skadi, the Winter Witch, the half-fae princess that Vhaja sometimes works with.  But… that’s impossible, isn’t it?

“The form she is showing is not her true one!” Revissa warns.  “She… must be gazing into our memories to construct an image for herself.”

The woman who is not Skadi smiles and runs a finger playfully along Revissa’s arm.

“And why would you say something like that, my little dear?  Or should I say deer?  Ho, how clever I can be!”

“Because… to me, you look like Un-Rama, the great Guardian Moth, and I know you are not her.”

The fey entity throws up her arms.  “Guilty as charged!  But what’s a little illusion between friends, no?  Because… we *are* friends… right?”

“That remains to be seen,” Revissa murmurs.

“Well, for your sake I hope we are friends.  Because you two are lost, and I know the way home.”

Suddenly, things start to make sense.  Hah!  So it wasn’t that you were reading the map poorly.  It’s that a trickster spirit was manipulating the terrain around you to make sure you ended up losing your way.

There is a pop and not-Skadi is behind you, gently stroking the fluff inside your left ear.

“No, my lost little doggie, you got yourself lost all on your own.  Though once you *were* lost… I might have bent things around a bit to make sure you stayed that way.”

“Why?!” Revissa demands.

“Because that way, I can make sure you play my game!”

You feel a shiver run down your spine… despite the warm (and not entirely unwelcome) presence of not-Skadi’s bosom compressed against your back.  It seems like things have just become very… interesting.  

[[Find out just how interesting-&gt;FD04B]]
]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="146" name="FD04B" tags="" position="2350,1400" size="100,100">“What kind of game?!” Revissa demands, stepping towards the suspicious woman.  “Actually, no, I don’t want to know, because it’s never a good idea to —”

And then her voice cuts off, because, suddenly, the scarf around her neck expands and bubbles out, forming a sort of balloon that has entirely encased her head.  No sound seems able to escape from the odd container, nor does light seem to be able to pass through it, as evidenced by your wife’s aimless flailing.  

“There, much better,” not-Skadi coos.  “A bit of a nag, isn’t she?  Though I suppose all wives are.”

Her voice is all levity, but you’re not laughing.  Though you know better to react aggressively.  You get the sense this woman, whatever she is, is quite powerful, and that any attempt at direct confrontation would end poorly for you.

“What do you want with us?” you eventually say.

“Just to have fun!  Is that such a crime?”

You watch as Revissa blindly stumbles over a tree root and falls to the ground.

“No offense… but I’m pretty sure anything you do for fun is going to be happening at our expense.”

The fae woman sighs dramatically and falls backwards into your arms.  “Ugh, this is the problem with experienced adventurers.  Always so suspicious.”

She disappears in a puff, and then reappears sitting on a tree branch above you.

“So, fine, how about this, Melfy my girl?  Just to show you I’m on the up-and-up.  I’ll help you out of the jam you’re in, free of charge!  You’re lost right now, and all you need to do is say the word and I’ll get you figured out.  How’s that sound?”

It isn’t lost on you that you have never told her your name, but she knows it anyway.  Isn’t a fae knowing your name supposed to be super dangerous?  You glance nervously towards Revissa. Surely she’d tell you not to trust anything this woman says.  But if she really is as powerful as it seems like she is, maybe you can get on her good side by going along with her nonsense.

“Well, what’s it going to be, wolfie?” she asks, holding out her hands.  Cartoon-like word bubbles appear on either side of her, filling out as she speaks the choices.

[[“Let me get you figured out?”-&gt;FD04C]]
[[“Or ignore the mysterious and beautiful stranger and get yourself lost all over again?”-&gt;FD04E]]

“Go ahead and click whichever one you like best!”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="147" name="FD04C" tags="" position="2375,1550" size="100,100">You sigh deeply, but eventually relent.

“Fine, you can help me,” you tell the grinning fae, pointing to the word bubble on her left.

The woman claps her hands brightly.  “Wonderful!  But, just to confirm - you want me to help you get figured out, right?”

“Okay, fine!” you say, throwing up your hands.  “Figure us out!”

A mischievous grin forms on not-Skadi’s lips as she snaps her fingers loudly enough to cause an echo between the trees.  “Granted!”

And that’s when you realize you screwed up.  Because all of a sudden, the forest surrounding you starts to grow, the branches of trees stretching away from you higher and higher.  Or… wait, maybe they’re not growing.  Maybe it’s *you* who is shrinking!

“Wha– what are you doing?” you ask in bewilderment, soon growing too small for your clothes to stay fixed on your body.  

“Exactly what you asked for!” is the only reply you get.

By the time it’s done, you’re standing maybe six inches high, and need to burrow your way out of the mountainous pile of clothing you’ve become buried in.  By the time you escape, you find an equally tiny Revissa waiting for you with a scowl on her face.

“Never agree to anything a fae offers you!” she shrieks.

“I just thought–”

“Don’t think, don’t try to outsmart them, don’t play along.  The best thing you can do is ignore them.  Come on, Melfy, we’ve been over this before!”

You scratch your head.  “We have?”

“Yes!  On multiple occasions, but you never list— wah!”

Your argument is cut off as two giant hands descend from the air, plucking each of your tiny bodies up by squeezing you tightly around the waist.  Suddenly you have ascended to dizzying heights, as you and your wife are held at eye level to the relatively giant fae woman.

“Aww… don’t fight, you two.  You make such a cute couple when you’re getting along.  In fact…”

Her eyes begin to glow with a bewitching power, and you feel your fear and irritation fading away.  Revissa’s scowl turns into a placid smile as well, both of you staring at each other with slack-jawed expressions.

“Much better.  Now why don’t the two of you show off how much you love each other?  Won’t that be more fun than yelling and fighting?”

It does sound much more fun.  You hate it when Revissa is mad at you, especially when you know she’s totally justified in feeling that way.  So you’re only too happy to agree to the perfectly reasonable request given to you by the mischievous fae.

Once she seems satisfied you’re both back on good turns, she carries your minimized bodies over to a nearby tree stump, where a small, round platform is waiting.  Beckoning, even.  It’s a strange feeling, but you become overwhelmed with the idea that this little platform is where you belong.  And though it’s only a few inches in diameter, it’s the perfect size to fit a wolf and deer who are eager to make up after a fight.

“Shall we?” you say, motioning to the pedestal.

Revissa nods, and allows you to take her by the hand as you step on top of it together.  The two of you spin around, pressing against each other back to back, linking hands as you turn your heads to smile at the fae woman towering above you.  Ready for whatever comes next.

“Perfect,” she says, as she snaps her fingers one more time.

[[Get figured out-&gt;FD04D]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="148" name="FD04E" tags="" position="2375,1675" size="100,100">You roll your eyes as you point to the word bubble on the right.

“No offense, but I’m pretty sure I’m not supposed to agree to anything a fae offers to me,” you say.  Your tone of voice is sincerely apologetic.  “Maybe you’d actually help, maybe you wouldn’t, but my wife would be upset with me if I actually went along with it.”

Rather than be upset, the fae woman simply claps her hands in amusement.

“What a dedicated spouse you are.  I’m impressed!”

You raise an eyebrow.  “You are?”

“It’s rare to find true love nowadays.  Yet you and your friends all seem to have it.”

That causes your eyebrow to raise even further.  “My friends?  You mean Krysta and Vhaja and the rest?”

“I’ve got my eye on all of you,” the fae woman says in a tone of voice that sounds chipper but has an ominous ring behind it.  “And I’m eager to see how all of you handle what lies ahead.”

You raise a hand to interject, but before a word gets out, the woman is gone.  Behind you, Revissa growls in annoyance as she finally gets the scarf off of her head.  She looks around quickly then runs over to you in a huff.  You give her the run-down of the exchange as best you can.

“Good.  Never trust a fae,” she says firmly.  “Never accept any of their deals.  Any help they give always comes at a cost too high to pay.”

It feels good that you’ve finally done something smart for once.  Though… it doesn’t solve the fact that you’re still lost…

But everyone makes mistakes.

It figures this would happen to you.  With a snap of her finger, the powerful fae trickster has transformed you and your wife into glossy plastic collectibles, mounted on top of a circular display stand.  Now your bodies are smooth and hard, sculpted action figures expertly crafted down to the finest detail.

Or would that be ‘in’action figures?

You’re both unable to move, of course.  Unable to speak.  Unable to complain as you’re bundled up into a nice little box and delivered to a curio shop that seems to exist outside of time and space.  You’re not the only items on display here - the place is full of various knick-knacks and antiques.  On one wall, a giant grandmother clock.  Hanging from the ceiling, model airplanes suspended on strings.  In the center of the floor, a marble birdbath.  And yet, upon closer inspection, everything within the room has a macabre secret to it - because every single one hides the form of a helpless woman, trapped or transformed by the fae’s wicked magic.  Behind the glass of the clock, a tsunojian is shackled in place, the pendulum tick-tocking between her two heaving breasts.  And within the seats of the airplanes are tiny, glossy pilots, kemomi women shrunken and transformed to forever operate the controls.  And the basin of the birdbath, of course, is clutched between the fingers of a petrified elvaan, the placid smile etched onto her face belying the terror she must have felt in the moment her fate was sealed.

As for the two of you, you’re placed at the corner of the reception desk at the front of the store.  Though the place rarely seems to get any customers.  Despite its appearance, this is not a place of business but a prison, housing the helpless souls of all the women the fae has decided to collect.  You and Revissa are two among many, doomed to maintain the same pose and glassy-eyed expressions for the rest of your days.

The fae woman seems to regret the fact that she didn’t collect the full set when she had the chance, that only you were foolish enough to stumble into her clutches.  It’s both a relief, knowing that your friends escaped the same fate, but also a source of regret.  You’ll probably never see any of them again, after all.

Eventually, the fae woman tires of you, and she allows one of her visitors to take you home.  But to your new owner, you and Revissa have even less emotional significance than you did for the original woman who caught you.  And so you end up changing hands many times over the years. Sometimes you’re loved and cherished, kept clean and dust-free in a place of prominence, and other times you’re shoved in a corner, lost in a back room, or forgotten entirely.  The one thing you never are is freed.  

And you never will be.  They say diamonds are forever - but apparently glossy statuettes are as well.  Next time, maybe you’ll be more careful about accepting help from a fae.

And so you find yourself stepping into a galaxy that has changed immensely since you were last a part of it.  An exciting new adventure, to be sure, but also rather outside the scope of this one.

You bring up the holo-image from your comm device, pointing at the location where you need to deposit the data collection device.

“Oh-ho… yes, I could show you the way…” says the tree.  “No trouble at all.  A fair trade for revitalizing these old roots of mine with your show.”

Well, at least something good has come from your mistake earlier with the pollen.  You’re about to agree to the trade, but then you get a soft elbow to the side from your wife.  With a sigh, you turn to her to see what the issue is.

“Something seems wrong…” Revissa says, looking towards you but with eyes darting suspiciously towards the tree.

“Weren’t *you* the one who wanted to ask the plants for help?”

“Yes… but… ugh, I don’t know.  Something just seems wrong to me.  I can’t put my finger on it, but I’m getting bad vibes from this whole thing.”

Well, bad vibes or no, you still have a mission to do.  And after losing several hours to aimless wandering and intense lovemaking, you really should be getting back to it.

If she thinks there’s something fishy here, she’s probably right.  But on the other hand, you can’t just turn down the opportunity to get things back on track.  Vhaja is counting on you to install these data devices.

“Alright… please show us the way,” you ask to the tree.

Revissa gives you a disapproving look.  You shrug your shoulders apologetically.

“Very well…” says the tree, in its creaking, wooden voice.  “All you need do is follow the sound of my voice.  This portion of the forest can be quite confusing.  Your senses cannot always be relied upon.  But my voice will ring true, and serve as a beacon.”

So there *was* something unnatural about the forest!  No wonder you were getting lost.  You puff out your chest proudly.  If you hadn’t triggered that pollen, the two of you wouldn’t have gotten frisky, and the tree wouldn’t have been there to get you out of this mess.  Sometimes the correct choice is to make a bunch of mistakes and get lucky right at the end.

Revissa rolls her eyes at you, but you maintain a bounce in your step as you head out into the woods once again.  As promised, the helpful tree guides you along the path, helping you overcome the otherwise distracting and disorienting twists and turns of this portion of the forest.  And eventually, you get far enough away from whatever the disturbance was that the map on your comm device seems to be working again, allowing you to navigate the rest of the way with your own skills.  Before long, you find yourself entering the very deepest part of the woods, a short distance from your destination.

The mission is obviously important, but *because* it’s important you need to avoid walking yourself into any traps that might trip you up.

“Look,” you say to the tree.  “I get you’re offering to help, but you’ve gotta see this from our perspective.  We’re in unfamiliar territory, and we’ve only just met you.  What proof do we have that you’re not, say, just going to lead us right into the grasp of a sexy spider-babe who’ll web us up and carry us away to her love-making nook?”

Revissa gives you the stink-eye.  You give her a shrug back.  Look, you’re still a bit horny, so you can’t be blamed if your thoughts are leaning towards the fetishistic.  

A low, raspy, grating laugh creaks out from the tree’s ‘mouth’.  It’s the sound of wood on wood, a disorienting scraping noise that doesn’t sound the least bit mirthful.

“You haven’t been reading ahead, have you?” says the tree.  “Picking the obvious Bad End path to get your jollies on before doubling back to try and actually win?”

You raise your eyebrow in confusion.  You’re not really sure what the tree is saying… but also it almost feels like it&#39;s talking to someone else other than you.  But who could that be?  It’s not like there’s anyone here but yourself and Revissa.

But as you spare your wife a glance, you notice she has become even more tense than earlier.  She narrows her eyes as she looks at the face etched into the wood in front of you.

“We… are not talking to a tree,” she eventually says.  “It is… some kind of fey spirit, I have to assume.  A trickster, playing a bit of a joke.  Making us think it’s a tree as a jape.”

Suddenly, there is a rush of sound, like sparkling firecrackers popping all around you, then a flash of motion as the leaves behind Revissa’s feet swirl in a multi-colored vortex.  You back away instinctively, reaching towards your sword, watching as a figure emerges from the storm and claps its hands.

Suddenly, things start to make sense.  Hah!  So it wasn’t that you were reading the map poorly.  It’s that a trickster spirit was manipulating the terrain around you to make sure you ended up losing your way.

There is a pop and not-Skadi is behind you, gently stroking the fluff inside your left ear.

“No, my lost little doggie, you got yourself lost all on your own.  Though once you *were* lost… I might have bent things around a bit to make sure you stayed that way.”

“Why?!” Revissa demands.

“Because that way, I can make sure you play my game!”

You feel a shiver run down your spine… despite the warm (and not entirely unwelcome) presence of not-Skadi’s bosom compressed against your back.  It seems like things have just become very… interesting.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="155" name="FD05D" tags="" position="2425,2100" size="100,100">“What kind of game?” you ask suspiciously.

Revissa kicks you in the shin.  “No, don’t even think about playing along.  Don’t interact, don’t entertain.  Never indulge the whims of a fae, or they’ll just take it as an invitation to keep on bothering you.”

“But don’t you worship Un-Rama?” you ask.  “She’s a fae spirit.”

“She’s different!  Un-Rama is a guardian and protector.  But this woman… is a trickster.  I can tell just by looking at her.  She wants nothing more than to lead us into a trap for her own entertainment.”

“You wound me!” not-Skadi says, miming being shot through the heart and falling backwards.  “And if I wasn’t in such a good mood after watching you two have sex, I’d probably turn you into a frog or something.  Which I *could* do, you know.  You wouldn’t have any defense against it.  Like it or not, I’m much more powerful than either of you, so really it’s in your best interest to entertain me.”

You step forward.  “Alright… let’s say I did want to entertain you.  What’s so special about us that someone as powerful as you has taken an interest?”

“Oh, it’s not the *us* so much as the *you*, my darling wolfie.  Or actually, your crew.  The Rabbit’s Foot Guild!  Erm, sorry, wrong universe.  The Rabbit’s Foot *Company*, as your merry little band of mercs is called.  Right?  You’re kind of a big deal.  Some might say the biggest deal in this universe.”

Okay, now you know she’s pulling your leg.  “Big deal?  I mean, sure, we had some adventures.  Maybe even helped save the galaxy once or twice.  But we’re still less famous than the knock-off cartoon series Icewing made based on us”

The fae woman giggles.  “Ooh, I love you throwing in a reference to the campaign that casual readers wouldn’t recognize.  But no, I don’t mean *in-universe* fame, I mean at the meta level.  The four of you are probably the most famous characters from this neck of the woods - other than the Demon Queen, I guess.”

“By the four of us… you mean me, Krysta, Vhaja, and Lumina?”

She claps her hands.  “Exactly!  Not gonna lie, I’m kind of disappointed you partnered up with the wifey here for the adventure - I prefer classic foursome perils, myself.  Which is why, to be perfectly honest, I don’t care for the deer girl - other than as a supporting character in your life.  So she really shouldn’t get a say in what happens next in our little tete-a-tete.”

Your head is spinning trying to wrap your mind around all of this, but there’s one thing you know for certain.  Despite the occasional butting of heads, you love Revissa with all your heart.  So you’re not going to just let her be sidelined in this discussion.  Instead you’re going to–

The fae woman snaps her fingers… and then Revissa is gone.  Not teleported, not carried away.  Like the frame containing her in the film reel was severed completely.

“I’m serious about this,” the woman says, pressing herself up against you.  “You’re the main character here, not her.  That’s why all the big important, plot-branching decisions always hinge on *your* choices.  I mean, seriously, have you noticed that some of the artwork is using older versions of her design?  Big pointy ears, no horns, that kind of stuff?  What shamelessly lazy production values.  Just commission new art if she’s so important, right?”

You’re not sure if you want to feel terrified or furious at this woman.  Or, to be fair, aroused.  She is still incredibly attractive, and her chest is nicely squishing itself against your arm.  But whatever she is, it is abundantly clear that she is far too powerful to confront directly.  And that you very well might need to play her game if you ever want to see your wife again.

The fae woman throws her hands up into the air theatrically.  “Oh, I thought you’d never ask!”

She snaps her fingers, and a structure appears with a pop in the center of the clearing you’ve been standing in.  It’s some kind of brightly colored, open-air tent, circular in construction with strangely shaped seats arranged around its circumference.

You narrow your eyes.  “What is this?”

“Our game, silly!”

You shake your head.  “Before we play any games, I want you to tell me what you did with Revissa.”

“Oh, but that’s just the thing - she’s already here!”

Her eyes dart towards the tent-like structure.  You follow where they are looking, and, after a moment of shocked revelation, have to stifle a gasp.

What you thought was a tent was actually an old-timey mechanized merry-go-round, the kind you might find at a carnival, or at Floofyland™.  But the seats on the ride are all hybridized female figures, half animal, half person.  Revissa, of course, often takes the form of what you lovingly call a deer-taur, a quadrupedal cervid with a humanoid torso.  And she’s taking that form now, but her body is stiff and glossy, with a pole through her midsection and a saddle painted onto her back.  

“Wh… what the hell have you done to her!” you yell, as your arm subconsciously reaches for the sword on your back.

The fae woman chuckles.  &quot;I’ve done to her something I could just as easily could do to you, if I wanted to.  And something I *will* do if your hand gets any closer to that sword.”

She vanishes in a puff of smoke, then reappears right beside you, pressing her bosom against your side.

“Need I remind you, I control her fate.  She’s become a glossy little prop, a background element of your story.  And she’ll stay that way unless you agree to play along.”

Her voice has become frighteningly ominous, and you can’t help but shiver with anxiety.  “Okay… fine.  It’s not like I have a choice.  I’ll play whatever game you have in mind.  But if’s a game, there *are* rules, right?  Rules that you’ll follow?”

“Of course!  I am a woman of my word, after all.  The rules are even quite simple.  We’re going to have a race!  You and I choose a mount, and whichever one makes three laps around the merry-go-round first is the winner!”

You narrow your eyes.  “And if I win, you’ll restore Revissa and let us go?”

“If you win you get a prize,” she says.  “Getting your wife back can be that prize, if you wish.”

This is why Revissa says not to trust the fae.  You can *feel* the way she is arranging her words, deliberately leaving wiggle room in any condition she agrees to.  If you were a smarter woman, you would try to parse where in her statement she might trip you up.  But you’re no lawyer, and you were never particularly good at riddles.  So all you can do is play along and hope your instincts kick in before you fall into one of her semantic traps.  But there is at least one thing you can confirm.

“Alright… so obviously I’m going to pick Revissa.  But I’ll only agree if you play fair.  Whichever mount you choose as your racer has to go at the same speed as Revissa does.”

“Done!” the fae says quickly.  *Too* quickly.  If she’s planning on cheating, clearly altering the speed of the racers isn’t how she’s going to do it.  But you can’t think of any more obvious hacks she could use.  

With no other ideas left, you trundle off to the merry-go-round and plop your butt down on Revissa’s smooth, glossy backside - something that requires a bit of maneuvering, given her long hair braid is stiffly protruding behind her, poking into your arm as you try to settle in.  Clearly this ride wasn’t built for comfort.  You wonder idly if she’s still conscious, if behind that placid smile frozen on her face she’s screaming at you to back out, or trying to tell you about the obvious trick you’re walking right into.  But if there are any words on her mind, they don’t escape her lips. 

All you can do is wrap your arms around her smooth shoulders and hold on, as the ride whirs to life.

You’re not going to play this woman’s game.  It’s a long shot, but maybe if you can get in a lucky hit you might be able to disorient her.  Reaching to your belt, you pull out your trusty blaster pistol and take aim, trying to shoot down the branch above the fae woman’s head.  However, when the energy bolt leaves the muzzle of your gun, it somehow arcs around and reverses course, dislodging a branch over your *own* head.  It strikes your noggin with a painful bump, making you dizzy for a moment.

So, flashing her your best smile, you prepare to turn up the charm.  Except, before you do, you find yourself being swept off your feet.

Everything had become a blur, and you felt like you were repeating yourself over and over again, trapped in a never-ending loop.  Your head is spinning as you finally bring yourself out of your funk, looking up with bleary eyes towards the fae woman.

“I… what?” you ask weakly.

“Yes, yes, I’m sure you’re quite exhausted, being led around in circles by the invisible hand of some higher power.  But luckily for you, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.  Or rather, a nice piece of plastic packaging.”

Through the fog of memory, you vaguely recall agreeing to something.  But… was that you?  It must have been… and yet, at the same time, it doesn’t add up.  Why would you ask to be–

But then the fae woman snaps her fingers, and the world falls out from under you again.  Everything spins, the scenery shifts, the world melts away… and now you’re somewhere else.  And you’re naked, too.

“Hey, what gives!”

And you’re not alone.  To your surprise, you find Krysta sitting next to you.  

“I… do not… my mind, my thoughts, so muddled…”

Vhaja as well.

“This… is… oof… why do I feel so dizzy…”

Even Lumina.  Just the four of you, you realize.  Revissa is still nowhere in sight.  Nor is Jyumon.  Though your head is throbbing, you remember the fae woman saying something to you… that she didn’t consider your wife a part of the crew.  That she liked things when it was just the four of you.  Is this an extension of that?  Has she kidnapped you all for some sick purpose?

“Whatever is going on… it’s clear we have to get out of here,” you say. 

But where exactly is here?  It appears to be… a factory of some kind?  You see conveyors belts, assembly lines, machinery of unknown make and purpose.  What is this place?  And what had the woman said… something about… packaging?

There is the sudden sound of rumbling movement, mechanisms whirring to life, and then a metal arm clamps down around your waist.  You’re hoisted into the air before you have a chance to resist it, and by the time you regain your bearings you’re already falling.  You land with a thud onto the surface of a conveyor belt, pulled onwards towards the interior of a processing booth of some kind.  You think about trying to roll off the platform, but are distracted from various cries of distress from beneath you.  Looking down, you see the rest of your friends are being ferried around in the same way you were.  But just as you prepare yourself to jump down to help them, more metal arms shoot out and clamp down around your wrists and ankles, dragging you through the mouth of the machine.

Suddenly there is darkness, as you feel yourself being manipulated.  You’re pushed backwards against a solid surface, and feel something jam a gag into your mouth.  A muffled grunt of confusion escapes your bound lips as you try to reach and pull it out, but more metal grabbers snap around your limbs and force them into place.  You feel restraints loop around you, snagging your ankles, your shins and thighs, then your wrists and elbows, around your waist, your neck, even two pressing in against your tail!

Once you’re secured, a blaring light switches on, making you blink in confusion as you see various items getting dragged in next to you.  They seem like bits of leather armor, some pants, a metal breastplate, clothing and equipment that you get the sense could fit your body, and seems oddly familiar… yet which you’re sure you’ve never worn before.  Each item is snapped in place, before a clear plastic barrier is dragged over and fitted over your body, an aperture in its side cut in the perfect shape to snap around your silhouette.  Only after you are finally carted out of the processing booth along the conveyor do you catch your reflection in a piece of machinery, and realize what has been done to you.

It’s… like you’ve been made up to look like an action figure!  Bound up in place, your clothing and weapon and gear slotted neatly into little holes specifically made to contain them.  What kind of bizarre trap is this?  You wriggle and squirm against the tight bindings, but you are helplessly anchored, unable to find any point of articulation to generate enough force to get free.  You feel a pit form in your stomach as you realize how completely powerless you now are.

Only once the ride starts does it occur to you to ask how, exactly, you’re supposed to have a race on a merry-go-round in the first place.  Isn’t the whole thing literally on rails?  Your opponent doesn’t seem to mind, however, having settled down on the back of a purple bunny-taur seat that seems oddly familiar to you for some reason.

She gives you a wave as the ride starts spinning and… her seat starts pulling ahead of yours after a quarter-turn around the center.

“What the hell?!” you yell, “you agreed we’d go the same speed!”

“Ah, but we are, my deer-riding dear, we are.”

In a panic, you inspect the ride more closely.  The ‘horses’ are arranged in a circle around the circumference of the central pillar in two concentric rings - an inner and an outer one.  Revissa is situated on the one farther from the center, whereas not-Skadi is in the inner circle.  You’re no mathematician, but you still grasp the issue.  Even if both circles are rotating at the same speed, the inner one has less distance to cross, which means it’s going to start pulling ahead in a relative sense once the ride gets going.  A pit forms in your stomach as you realize by demanding both mounts move at the same speed you were actually giving yourself a handicap.  Your opponent notices the change on your face and gives you a wink as she happily sails forward.

If you don’t do something, you’re going to lose!

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="162" name="FD06C" tags="" position="2575,1400" size="100,100">Well if the ride is rigged against you, that just means you need to target the rider instead.  Perching up on your seat, you spend a moment to calculate your trajectory, then make a diving lunge towards the shapely fae’s body.  To be honest, it’s a fairly desperate ploy - which is why it surprises you when it works.

You feel soft flesh against your skin as you collide with your opponent, knocking her from her perch and slamming her against the central rotating pillar.  Now you have her pinned beneath you, your powerful arms pressed down on her shoulders to prevent her from regaining her position.  And yet… she does not seem the least bit perturbed.

“Oh… so forward.  And here I thought I’d only give you a kiss if you won.”

There’s only time for you to blink in confusion before she leans in against you and warmly locks lips.  And then… your world falls into a pleasant blur.  You have a vague recollection of hands and teeth and exposed nipples on milky white skin, of dark, silken hair swishing against your back, of hands roughly stroking the fur on your ears and tail.  It feels like it lasts for an eternity, and yet, at the same time, that it is over too soon.

What breaks the reverie is the sound of a victory fanfare blaring from the merry-go-round’s tinny speakers, announcing that a winner has crossed the finish line first.  You look at the fae woman in confusion as she lustily strokes the inner fuzz on your ear with a hand.

“Oh, silly girl.  The rule was whose mount crossed first, not which rider.  And since I was ahead when we started, it means I’m still ahead when you’ve finished.”

A wicked smile crosses her lips as she stands up.

“And you *are* finished, my dear.”

And then she snaps her fingers.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="163" name="FD06D" tags="" position="2725,1400" size="100,100">As you fumble for solutions, you get the idea that if Revissa were tightly tethered to the bunny-taur with a strong enough rope, she would essentially get pulled along by the ‘faster’ of the two mounts.  But where can you find a sturdy rope on such short notice?  Looking around, your eyes rest on the colorful banners flapping in the breeze on the outside of the ride, which are attached to the ‘tent’ portion with some thin wires.  Maybe those will do the trick!

Careful of the rotation of the ride beneath you, you reach out, grasping hold of a banner and tugging it down.  To your satisfaction, it comes loose easily.  Then as quick as you are able, you tear off the cloth banner to get to the binding beneath it, giving it a pull to test its strength.  It’ll have to do.  You’re no cowgirl, but you manage to form a passable loop from the metal cord, and then swing it over your head, taking careful aim.

When it’s set loose from your grip, you hold your breath, carefully trying to use your wrist to maneuver it into place - and you’re rewarded by a tug as it finds purchase around the bunny-taur’s neck.  Success!

After that, it’s a simple process to tie the cord around Revissa’s own glossy midsection, tethering her and the lead rider together.  You’re soon rewarded by a heavy creak as the line goes taut, forcing the outer circle to rotate faster to keep up with the inner one.  

The fae woman shifts in her seat, delicately twanging the cord with a finger.

“How clever,” she says with a smile.  But she takes no further action to impede your progress.

If the ride is rigged to ensure Revissa falls behind, then you’ll just have to physically change it so that it doesn’t.  The two rows of ‘horses’ are arranged on separate, concentrically rotating circles, so if you could somehow manage to jam up the one containing the fae woman’s mount then yours would be able to get ahead.

Leaping from Revissa’s smooth, shiny back, you land on the surface of the ride itself, and pull out your sword from its place at your back.  Getting down on all fours, you carefully study the seam between the two rotating circles, finding a spot that looks like it might be vulnerable to tampering.  Then you jam the end of your blade into the gap, trying to dig it down as far as it can go to mess with whatever gears are turning beneath the surface.

You’re rewarded with an ear-splitting screech as metal grinds against metal, and feel a jolt as half the ride grinds to a halt.  The fae woman looks backwards from her position ahead of you, scowling in annoyance.  You give her a winning smile back, prompting her to flick her finger upwards.  Suddenly, your sword rises up into the air and then sails away into the forest, useless to you for the remainder of the race.  The merry-go-round hums back into full operation, chugging along as not-Skadi continues on her merry way.  But at least you gained some ground.

You’ve been taken back to where you first met the beguiling fae, transported so effortlessly you hadn’t even realized you were being moved.  Everything around the clearing looks more or less the same, but now there is a large structure dominating its center.  It’s some kind of brightly colored, open-air tent, circular in construction with strangely shaped seats arranged around its circumference.

“Hopefully it wasn’t too bumpy a ride?” she asks sweetly.

The woman who looks like Skadi sits on a tree stump at the edge of the clearing, crossing and uncrossing her legs alluringly.  Your eyes, unbidden, trace the outline of her thighs, and the way her chest rises and falls with each breath.  Sure, she’s just picking a woman from your memory to present herself as - but that woman is *hot*.  If anything, it would be rude *not* to appreciate the aesthetics, as it were, of the situation.  Though perhaps you appreciate them for a bit too long before you realize that something is missing.

“Wait… where’s Revissa?”

Not-Skadi smiles distantly.

“Oh, she’s here.  Already all set up for our little game.”

Her eyes dart towards the tent-like structure.  You follow where they are looking, and, after a moment of shocked revelation, have to stifle a gasp.

(link:&quot;Honestly, I quite think this is an improvement for her.  Don&#39;t you, reader?&quot;)[(show:?drink1)]

What you thought was a tent is actually an old-timey mechanized merry-go-round, the kind you might find at a carnival, or at Floofyland™.  But the seats on the ride are all hybridized female figures, half animal, half person.  Revissa, of course, often takes the form of what you lovingly call a deer-taur, a quadrupedal cervid with a humanoid torso.  And she’s taking that form now, but her body is stiff and glossy, with a pole through her midsection and a saddle painted onto her back.  

“Wh… what the hell have you done to her!” you yell.

Your clothing and equipment has all mysteriously returned to your body since the tar pit incident, almost like it was never removed in the first place.  But you have more pressing matters on your mind at the time, as your arm subconsciously reaches for the sword on your back.

The fae woman chuckles.  I’ve done to her something I could just as easily could do to you, if I wanted.  And something I *will* do if your hand gets any closer to that sword.”

She vanishes in a puff of smoke, then reappears right beside you, pressing her bosom against your side.

“Need I remind you, you *agreed* to play my game.  So now you don’t get to protest the rules.”

You let your hand go limp.  “But there *are* rules, right?  Rules that you’ll follow?”

“Of course!  I am a woman of my word, after all.  The rules are even quite simple.  We’re going to have a race!  You and I choose a mount, and whichever one makes three laps around the merry-go-round first is the winner!”

You narrow your eyes.  “And if I win, you’ll restore Revissa and let us go?”

“If you win you get a prize,” she says.  “Getting your wife back can be that prize, if you wish.”

This is why Revissa says not to trust the fae.  You can *feel* the way she is arranging her words, deliberately leaving wiggle room in any condition she agrees to.  If you were a smarter woman, you would try to parse where in her statement she might trip you up.  But you’re no lawyer, and you were never particularly good at riddles.  So all you can do is play along and hope your instincts kick in before you fall into one of her semantic traps.  But there is at least one thing you can confirm.

“Alright… so obviously I’m going to pick Revissa.  But I’ll only agree if you play fair.  Whichever mount you choose as your racer has to go at the same speed as Revissa does.”

“Done!” the fae says quickly.  *Too* quickly.  If she’s planning on cheating, clearly altering the speed of the racers isn’t how she’s going to do it.  But you can’t think of any more obvious hacks she could use.  

With no other ideas left, you trundle off to the merry-go-round and plop your butt down on Revissa’s smooth, glossy backside - something that requires a bit of maneuvering, given her long hair braid is stiffly protruding behind her, poking into your arm as you try to settle in.  Clearly this ride wasn’t built for comfort.  You wonder idly if she’s still conscious, if behind that placid smile frozen on her face she’s screaming at you to back out, or trying to tell you about the obvious trick you’re walking right into.  But if there are any words on her mind, they don’t escape her lips. 

All you can do is wrap your arms around her smooth shoulders and hold on, as the ride whirs to life.

Krysta is trapped with her arms at her sides, her hands balled up into fists as she tries to squirm against the restraints.  Normally she’s a veritable escape artist, but nothing she does seems to loosen her bindings.  Her gear is more leather armor, her weapons a pair of shortswords instead of her classic vibra-dagger and ice-blaster pistol.]

Vhaja comes next, trapped in place with her arms out at her sides.  Oddly, she doesn’t have a gag between her lips, something that would normally be a given for a magic-user - but instead she has little straps around each of her fingers, completely immobilizing her hands, preventing her from making any arcane gesture.  Her kit is complete with a dark black robe and an actual bow-and-arrow combo, a physical weapon instead of the magical energy arrows she usually forms with her spellcraft.]

Bringing up the rear is Lumina, her hands bound above her head, her wings spread out and fixed in place like she was a butterfly pinned and mounted to a collector’s display board.  The outfit included in her display stand is the same teal-and-gold color as her normal fare, but looks more like traditional fantasy clerical robes than the tight shinium leotard she usually wears.  She’s been physically gagged as well, a defeated look on her face as she is lowered down beside the rest of you.

“And so, my collection is complete!”

The fae woman appears in a puff of smoke to inspect her new trophies.  All of you are completely helpless, able to do nothing but wiggle and squirm.  Vhaja yells something out, but her voice is muffled by the plastic casing, making her words incomprehensible.  The rest of you, being gagged, make even less sense as you try to voice your complaints at the situation you now find yourselves in.

“So, let’s go over a few details of your situation,” not-Skadi says, walking down the line of her new prizes.  “Firstly, these bindings are all magical in nature.  Totally inescapable, so don’t bother trying - though I never mind watching you squirm.  And, of course, they’ll keep you all hale and hearty for as long as you need to be.  Which brings me to the second detail - yup, this situation is a permanent one.  I’m keeping you all forever, and no one will ever be able to find you.  So go ahead and dash any hopes of rescue from those pretty little heads of yours.  And thirdly - don’t worry, it’s Game Over for your girlfriends, too.  Just because they’re not part of your original crew doesn’t mean I won’t be keeping them forever in my collection.”

A ballgag snaps itself over her lips, shiny tape wraps around her hands, just as a heavy armbinder snags her limbs and wrenches them behind her back.  Invisible hands tear off her clothing, as belts appear from thin air to restrain her legs.

By now, she realizes she’s been caught, but she still has enough mobility to hop lamely to the side.  At least until the spectral arms start to drag her away.]

A slap on the butt sends her tumbling to the ground, before she’s pulled a short distance to a waiting golden box.  It’s almost coffin-shaped, and is the perfect size to fit her body as the lid is slammed closed and locked with a resounding snap.

“There we are - snug as a bug in a rug.  Or a fox in a box, as it were.  But now we have one more special guest to add to my archive…”

Another snap of her fingers, and another spotlight switches on.  You see Revissa, arms bound behind her back and standing between two long poles, a piece of shiny tape slapped over her lips.  She squirms helplessly in place as a device switches on, two rollers spinning along the poles to begin winding glossy lengths of plastic wrap around her body.]

The machine does not stop until she’s fully mummified, head to toe in the stuff, and a heat lamp runs over her to shrink-wrap the plastic into a full-on lamination.  She can only writhe helplessly, trying to make eye contact with you through the opaque coverings, before more loading arms pick her up, drop her in a metal case, and lock it shut.

“Oh, don’t look so broken up about it!” the fae woman says, walking over to gently jostle your packaging.  “Surely you see what I mean, right?  Her design is all wrong here - no horns, ears the wrong shape, and did you see how some of her face tattoos were lacking an outline?  That’s because the person who drew the lineart forgot them in the sketch, and they were only added when someone else colored it in.  Shameful.”

Behind her, the two cases containing your captive lovers are loaded onto cranes and taken away to parts unknown, leaving the four of you alone with your tormentor.

“Compare that to the four of you - your designs have been remarkably consistent ever since your first conception in that silly dress-up game program.  Sure, hairstyles change up a bit, and sometimes artists forget the splash of brown at the tips of your ears and tail - and, okay, some people don’t draw you with as much muscle as they should –” she says, poking at the packaging around your belly area “-- but overall, your four have really wonderful designs.  Obviously, Krysta being a squirrel is a new thing, but she’s still recognizable - though I’m gonna be honest, I actually prefer her as a human.  It’s a classic, you know?  And Vhaja, my dear, your chest has gotten larger over the years.  You were supposed to be the short and thin one, but sometimes you’re as busty as dear Lumina.  And, by the way, Lumina?  No notes.  Your design has always been perfect.”

None of you are able to offer commentary on the woman’s incredibly bizarre and erratic monologue, only able to fruitlessly push against your bindings.

“Anyway… I had my fun, messed around with you all a bit, and in the end decided you were worthwhile additions to my collection.  And so, that’s where you’ll all stay - forever, of course.  Now… let’s find someplace to put you on display…”

You’re kept in a place akin to a curio shop, full of various knick-knacks and antiques.  On one wall, a giant grandmother clock.  Hanging from the ceiling, model airplanes suspended on strings.  In the center of the floor, a marble birdbath.  And yet, upon closer inspection, everything within the room has a macabre secret to it - because every single one hides the form of a helpless woman, trapped or transformed by the fae’s wicked magic.

And within the seats of the airplanes are tiny, glossy pilots, kemomi women shrunken and transformed to forever operate the controls.

At least back in those first few years.  But as the crew grew, positions changed.  You’ll never forget the falling out you and Krysta had, prompting her to leave for a few weeks and become a Star Scout.  After that Vhaja became First Mate.  But still, Krysta eventually came back, and your crew expanded, and more ships joined the company, and you became heroes.  Maybe not famous ones, but it’s impossible to deny the effect you had on the galaxy.  And now… you’re here, locked away in a curio shop outside of time and space, trapped forever.

If there is any silver lining, it’s that it’s easy to let your mind wander, to lose track of time, to tune out the universe and just *exist*, as a thing, and not a person.  Every once in a while, your eyes rest on the corner where that big metal box is, and you wonder how Revissa is doing, locked away, out of sight.  You wish more than anything that, at the very least, you could have been trapped together.  And for a few days after that you’ll feel a pang of regret and sadness, a yearning for a different ending to your story, before your mind returns to its pleasant fog.

But that’s all it is - a yearning.  Not truth, not reality.  Because the fact of the matter is, you’re here, you’re trapped, and you’re never, ever going to be anywhere else.

To your surprise, one day, you get your wish.  Once she captured you, your fae captor mostly ignored you, occasionally taking some time out of her day to stare, maybe make a snide comment.  But you start to notice that, as the ages flow by, every time she draws near you, she grows increasingly irate.  Testy, irritable.  You can’t for the life of you imagine why - it’s not like you have any agency at all to influence her mood.  But one day she comes out and says it.  What feels like a lifetime ago, you sucked down a Star Scout homing beacon, and ever since you’ve been captured it’s been sending out pulses into the void.  Useless to attract help, but effective in creating an obnoxious ringing in her ear.  Because the Scouts are formed around the tenets of love and happiness, even her fae magic can’t just undo the signal.  So she just tries to live with it.  But eventually, the benefit of keeping you outweighs the annoyance.

All at once, you and your friends appear in a naked pile in the middle of a remote planet.  No gear, no equipment, no idea how long you’ve been gone, or how you’ll make your way back to civilization.  She doesn’t care - she just wants to put an end to the incessant ringing.  Then she vanishes in her signature puff of smoke, leaving your party to their own devices.

What follows is an exciting adventure in its own right, but it’s not the adventure we’re here to tell today.  And, regardless, your actions have led to failing your original mission.  Maybe next time you’ll think better about getting tangled up with a fae.

You’ve been stripped naked, forcibly posed in an at-attention position with your sword clutched between your hands.  Your feet have become embedded in a large, round platform, holding you in place, and your body has been coated, head to toe, in gleaming silver paint that has hardened atop your bare skin.  The end result is to transform you into the very thing you ‘won’ for your second-place finish - a silver trophy. 

“Now then… we established what would happen if *you* won the race, but we never hammered out the details if *I* won.  But I suppose there’s no time like the present.  So why don’t I propose some options.  If you don’t like them, just say no and we’ll think of something else.”

“....”

With your lips frozen in place, you can’t make a sound, one way or another.  

“So, how about this?  If the game ends with me as the winner, I’ll keep your lovely wife as part of my merry-go-round for the rest of eternity, and you as my lovely little trophy for the same duration.  Neither of you will ever be freed without my express approval, and no one will ever be able to save you.  How does that sound?”

“...!” 

You try to yell out a protest, but the fae woman cannot hear you.

She pokes your nose playfully.  “Just say ‘no I do not accept these terms’ and I’ll come up with something better.  But while we’re pitching ideas… how about I also track down your other friends and add them to my collection as well?  Say something if you disagree.”

“........!”

“You’re sure?  All you need to do is say the words – otherwise I’ll assume you accept my proposal.”

“.......................!”

“Well, if you insist… very well.  The deal is agreed upon.  You and your wife shall now belong to me for the rest of time.  And I’ll go ahead and capture the rest of your merry crew as well!”

A terrible dread sits in to the pit of your stomach as you can somehow *feel* the contract coming into effect.  This is just about the worst outcome imaginable.  You continue trying to catch her attention, blinking furiously, helplessly straining against the solid shell built around your body, but she ignores your continued protests as she looks towards the merry-go-round, still cheerily spinning along, even after the race has ended.  And then she holds out her hand and, through a trick of visual perspective, picks it up and holds it in her palm.  Now it’s the size of a snow globe, Revissa just one of many tiny figures trapped within its confines.

“More portable this way,” she says with a grin.  “The perfect size to sit on a shelf, right next to my sexy little bedroom award, wouldn’t you say?”

You wouldn’t, but you can’t.  All you can do is stand there in place as she takes a few steps back and does the same trick with you – and then, suddenly, you’re only ten inches tall, your metal body able to be snugly gripped in a single hand.  Tears creep at the corners of your eyes as you realize just how helpless you are, just how completely you’ve been defeated.  Revissa was right - never trust a fae.  You’d have been better off being lost in that forest forever.  But instead, now you’re both just two more playthings in the collection of an impossibly powerful being.

And with another snap of her fingers, you vanish from the forest, never to return again.

You drop to the floor of the merry-go-round, then hop over the railing, standing on soft soil as you jog alongside Revissa’s cheerily bobbing figure.  Up and down, up and down she goes, moving in time with the carnival music blaring from the speakers.  In the end, the ride is just a machine, right?  Powered by gears and pulleys and other mechanical apparatus.  Well, you’re pretty strong.  Maybe even strong enough to do it better.

Reaching out, you clasp your hand around Revissa’s glossy fingers, holding on tight as you try to increase the pace of your movements.  You pull her along behind you, muscles straining as you attempt to increase the rotation speed of the outer circle of the carnival attraction with pure force of muscle.  And to your delight, it actually works.  You start to gain ground, you and Revissa closing in on not-Skadi and her bunny-taur mount.  And interestingly, as the rotation speed increases, so too does the tempo of the carnival music, as if the two were inexorably tied together.  Not surprising, given fae magic is responsible for the whole thing.  

To be perfectly honest, it looks like it could have worked.  *Could* have.  If only you’d started a bit closer to your opponent.  Because after a full circuit around the track, your strength begins to wane, your heart pounds in your chest, and your legs become sluggish, like you’re pulling yourself through an ocean of molasses.  Eventually, you just can’t keep up, and your fingers slip from Revissa’s hands, even as you were only a few feet away from the rider ahead of you.

The fae woman throws her head back and waves, hair whipping in the wind as she pulls ahead past the finish line.  Her arrival is punctuated by a tinny fanfare from the ride’s speakers, declaring her the winner - and you, unfortunately, the loser.

“Oh, my poor deer, it looks like you didn’t finish first.  Though… you *are* finished.”

And before you get a chance to respond, she snaps her fingers.

If the ride is rigged to ensure Revissa falls behind, then you’ll just have to physically change it so that it doesn’t.  The two rows of ‘horses’ are arranged on separate, concentrically rotating circles, so if you could somehow manage to jam up the one containing the fae woman’s mount then yours would be able to get ahead.

Leaping from Revissa’s smooth, shiny back, you land on the surface of the ride itself, and pull out your sword from its place at your back.  Getting down on all fours, you carefully study the seam between the two rotating circles, finding a spot that looks like it might be vulnerable to tampering.  Then you jam the end of your blade into the gap, trying to dig it down as far as it can go to mess with whatever gears are turning beneath the surface.

You’re rewarded with an ear-splitting screech as metal grinds against metal, and feel a jolt as half the ride grinds to a halt.  The fae woman looks backwards from her position ahead of you, scowling in annoyance.  You give her a winning smile back, prompting her to flick her finger upwards.  Suddenly, your sword rises up into the air and then sails away into the forest, useless to you for the remainder of the race.  The merry-go-round hums back into full operation, chugging along as not-Skadi continues on her merry way.  But now you’re neck-and-neck with her.

[[Leap and tackle her off her mount-&gt;FD06C]]
[[Lash your mounts together evenly-&gt;FD06I]]
[[Try and pull Revissa ahead with brute strength-&gt;FD06J]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="173" name="FD06F" tags="" position="2600,1550" size="100,100">As you fumble for solutions, you get the idea that if Revissa were tightly tethered to the bunny-taur with a strong enough rope, Revissa would essentially get pulled along by the ‘faster’ of the two mounts.  But where can you find a sturdy rope on such short notice?  Looking around, your eyes rest on the colorful banners flapping in the breeze on the outside of the ride, which are attached to the ‘tent’ portion with some thin wires.  Maybe those will do the trick!

Careful of the rotation of the ride beneath you, you reach out, grasping hold of a banner and tugging it down.  To your satisfaction, it comes loose easily.  Then as quick as you are able, you tear off the cloth banner to get to the binding beneath it, giving it a pull to test its strength.  It’ll have to do.  You’re no cowgirl, but you manage to form a passable loop from the metal cord, and then swing it over your head, taking careful aim.

When it’s set loose from your grip, you hold your breath, carefully trying to use your wrist to maneuver it into place - and you’re rewarded by a tug as it finds purchase around the bunny-taur’s neck.  Success!

…though it’s a fleeting one.  Because despite getting it where it needed to be, you now realize that your opponent has already gotten too far ahead in the race, leaving you without enough slack to secure it around Revissa.  Lamely, you try to hold on as tight as you can, but the wire soon slips from your grip, dragging uselessly around the circuit of the track.

A few minutes later you hear the sound of a victory fanfare blaring from the merry-go-round’s tinny speakers, announcing that a winner has crossed the finish line first.  Needless to say, it wasn’t you.  The fae woman looks backwards from her mount, flashing you a victorious smile.

“Oh, my poor deer, it looks like you didn’t finish.  Though… you *are* finished.”

And before you get a chance to respond, she snaps her fingers.

[[Claim second place-&gt;FD07A]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="174" name="FD06I" tags="" position="2600,1675" size="100,100">Now that you’ve caught up, the lasso you’ve tied has fallen slack, no longer serving any purpose.  But you can change that.  If you tighten the tension between the two mounts and fully lash them together, your opponent won’t be able to gain any more distance.  You’d finally be on even ground!

The fae woman watches you with interest as you get to work, seemingly unperturbed by your plan.  In fact, she even helpfully presses a finger against the rope at one point to make it easier to tie a knot.  Her compliance is obviously unsettling.  Why would she be helping you win?  Are you making a mistake?  Or is it some kind of reverse psychology, trying to trick you away from the best option by making it seem like that’s what she wants?

In the end, you know you’re never going to outsmart a fae.  So you just stick with the plan and hope it works.  Before long, Revissa and the bunny mount are tightly connected, moving as one unit as the merry-go-round happily chugs along.  It is only as the finish line approaches that you realize the issue – if they’re both neck and neck, that means they’ll end the race at the same time!  You won’t lose, but you also won’t win.  And you *need* to win if you want to make her honor her deal to turn Revissa back to normal.

“Looks like you’ve figured it out,” the fae woman says with a chuckle.  “Well, how about it?  Do you have any more ideas?  Or will you just accept a tie?”

With the finish line looming, you only have a few moments to make a choice.

[[Accept a tie-&gt;FD06O]]
[[Cut the line and pull Revissa ahead-&gt;FD06P]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="175" name="FD06J" tags="" position="2725,1675" size="100,100">You’ve run out of better ideas to win the race, so you decide that in the end, you’re just going to stick with what you know best.  You drop to the floor of the merry-go-round, then hop over the railing, standing on soft soil as you jog alongside Revissa’s cheerily bobbing figure.  Up and down, up and down she goes, moving in time with the carnival music blaring from the speakers.  In the end, the ride is just a machine, right?  Powered by gears and pulleys and other mechanical apparatus.  Well, you’re pretty strong.  Maybe even strong enough to do it better.

Reaching out, you clasp your hand around Revissa’s glossy fingers, holding on tight as you try to increase the pace of your movements.  You pull her along behind you, muscles straining as you attempt to increase the rotation speed of the outer circle of the carnival attraction with pure force of muscle.  And to your delight, it actually works.  You start to pull ahead, you and Revissa slowly chugging past not-Skadi and her bunny-taur mount.  And interestingly, as the rotation speed increases, so too does the tempo of the carnival music, as if the two were inexorably tied together.  Not surprising, given fae magic is responsible for the whole thing.  

The soft sound of clapping hands pulls your attention behind you.

“My oh my, what a show!” the fae woman says excitedly, watching intently as sweat pours down your brow, making your muscled physique glisten in the forest air.

She snaps her fingers, and a gust of wind picks up, sending a refreshingly cool chill over your body, before, somehow, it picks up and slides all your clothes off your frame, sending boots and pants and shirts scattering every which way.  It leaves you naked and exposed, every aspect of your anatomy on display for her enjoyment as you try to pull your wife across the finish line.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="176" name="FD06O" tags="" position="2600,1950" size="100,100">You look your opponent over, studying her features.  It’s impressive enough that you’ve even managed to make it this far.  Perhaps a tie is the best you can hope for.  Trying anything more would just prompt her to negate your efforts and cause a loss.  Negotiating with a fae is a fool’s errand at best, but at least trying it now you’d be at a place of parity, rather than from a disadvantage.

“Fine,” you eventually say, unable to hide the resignation in your voice.  “I guess I have no choice.”

“So you accept the tie?” the woman chirps.

“Yes, fine, I accept a tie!”

Her face lights up.  “Oh I *was* hoping you’d say that!”

It is only after she snaps her finger that you realize just how foolish it was to let her phrase it like that.  At the sound of her command, the metal wires you’d tied between the two mounts start to come to life, writing around like serpents with a mind of their own.  You don’t even have a moment to react before they leap towards you, transforming into thick leather bands that shred your clothing to pieces as they start to wind themselves around your body.  They curl around your ankles, shins and thighs, catching your arms and wrapping your wrists together behind your back, securing themselves below your breasts and around your shoulders to prevent any attempt at breaking free.  Another snap of her fingers, and a rubber ball shoots forward and presses itself between your lips, more bands shooting out of it to form a tight and secure gag that cuts off any sounds from your mouth besides some plaintive grunts.

Ahead of you, the two horses cross the finish line at exactly the same time, ending literally neck and neck.  A tinny fanfare goes off from the merry-go-round’s loudspeaker, indicating that the race has ended in – you guessed it – a tie.

[[End the race-&gt;FD07C]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="177" name="FD06P" tags="" position="2725,1950" size="100,100">You’re not looking for a stalemate here.  You’re trying to win!  And you aren’t going to do that by crossing the finish line together.  So there’s nothing else to do but to cut the bonds you just made.  Unfortunately, you don’t have your sword any more, but you do still have the enchanted dagger that Vhaja lent to you.  You pull the blade from your belt and quickly work on severing the lines, pleased to find that the metal cables snap easily with only a slight bit of pressure.  And once the two mounts are freed, you leap off of Revissa’s back to the ground, taking hold of her hand to start pulling her ahead, using your own speed to outrun the ‘faster’ mount on the inner circle of the ride.

A surge of adrenaline rushes through you, strengthening your muscles as you burn every ounce of stamina to take you through the last leg of the race.   To your delight, it actually works!  You start to pull ahead, you and Revissa slowly chugging past not-Skadi and her bunny-taur mount.  And interestingly, as the rotation speed increases, so too does the tempo of the carnival music, as if the two were inexorably tied together.  Not surprising, given fae magic is responsible for the whole thing.  

Behind you, the fae woman does not seem to mind that you’re about to win.  In fact, she’s rather enjoying the show.  So much so that she snaps her fingers, causing a gust of wind to swirl around you that sends a refreshingly cool chill over your body, before, somehow, it picks up and slides all your clothes off your frame, sending boots and pants and shirts scattering every which way.  It leaves you naked and exposed, every aspect of your anatomy on display for her enjoyment as you finally manage to pull your wife across the finish line.

Your victory is announced with a tinny fanfare blasting from the merry-go-round’s loudspeakers, indicating that, against all odds, you actually managed to win the race.  The fae woman simply smiles and claps her hands politely, her eyes darting up and down your naked, sweat-covered body.

“Congratulations.  You’ve impressed me with your ingenuity… and other assets.  Now how about we throw you a victory party?”

[[Claim your prize-&gt;FD07]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="178" name="FD06Q" tags="" position="2850,1950" size="100,100">An idea strikes you as the racers inch towards the finish line - even if the two mounts are tied together, there’s still a tiny bit of wiggle room between them.  And if you could just jam yourself between the mounts, maybe you could shift them just enough so that Revissa’s head nudges forwards, and the bunny-taur’s body falls backwards.  To do so, however, requires you to brace yourself in between the two ‘horses’, your arms wrapped around Revissa’s neck and your legs anchored on the bunny’s bum.  Luckily, your earlier rope-work has left the two in relatively stable balance, allowing you to span the distance between them without falling onto the track below.

After that, it’s just a matter of applying the right force.  Tensing your arms, bracing your legs, and heaving with all the strength your muscles can muster.  You grunt in exertion as the ride nears the goal, barely managing to fight the tension in the ropes and the force of the merry-go-round itself to bend Revissa just a centimeter forward.  Barely a difference, but winning by a nose is still winning.

But… maybe you should have given the plan a bit more thought.  Because, stretched as you are, your legs against not-Skadi’s mount, your taut rump is in open view of your opponent, presenting a tantalizing target.  She takes the unintentionally offered bait, reaching out with two fingers to deliver a sharp, distracting pinch right onto your pert bottom.  The sudden pressure makes you yelp in surprise, shifting the tension in your muscles to reverse the positions of the riders!

It happens only for a moment, but it’s the only moment that matters, as when you finally cross the finish line it’s the bunny-taur’s nose that is ahead.  A tinny fanfare from the merry-go-round’s loudspeaker announces the crowning of a winner.  A winner that, sadly, is not you.

“Oh… so close.  A mishap right at the finish,” the fae woman says.  “But sorry to say, now you *are* finished…”

And then with a smile, she snaps her fingers.

[[Claim second place-&gt;FD07A]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="179" name="FD06K" tags="" position="2850,1675" size="100,100">Well if she’s trying to distract you, that just means you need to distract her instead.  Perching up on your seat, you spend a moment to calculate your trajectory, then make a diving lunge towards the shapely fae’s body.  To be honest, it’s a fairly desperate ploy - which is why it surprises you when it works.

You feel soft flesh against your skin as you collide with your opponent, knocking her from her perch and slamming her against the central rotating pillar.  Now you have her pinned beneath you, your powerful arms pressed down on her shoulders to prevent her from regaining her position.  And yet… she does not seem the least bit perturbed.

“Oh… so forward.  Are you trying to claim your prize early?”

There’s only time for you to blink in confusion before she leans in against you and warmly locks lips.  And then… your world falls into a pleasant blur.  You have a vague recollection of hands and teeth and exposed nipples on milky white skin, of dark, silken hair swishing against your back, of hands roughly stroking the fur on your ears and tail.  It feels like it lasts for an eternity, and yet, at the same time, that it is over too soon.

What breaks the reverie is the sound of a victory fanfare blaring from the merry-go-round’s tinny speakers, announcing that a winner has crossed the finish line.  You look at the fae woman in confusion as she lustily strokes the inner fuzz on your ear with a hand.

“Don’t look so surprised.  It’s not like this game was impossible or anything - there has to be *some* chance that you come ahead.”

Sure enough, Revissa’s glossy figure is a few inches in front of the opposing mount, making her - and thus, you - the winner of the race.  

“It was a lot of fun, wasn’t it?” the fae woman says, lazily rolling out from beneath you and manifesting her clothing back onto her body with a snap of her fingers.  “Now why don’t we throw you a little victory party.”

Her eyes sparkle alluringly, and you find yourself nodding along in compliance at her words.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="180" name="FD06L" tags="" position="2600,1800" size="100,100">You’re not going to let her distract you from winning - not when you’ve finally managed to pull ahead!  So, despite the sudden loss of clothing, you keep at what you were doing, holding on to Revissa for deer life as you pull her closer and closer to the goal.  You can feel your strength starting to give out, your muscles screaming for relief, every inch of you slick and glistening with perspiration, but you push them onwards for just a little bit longer.  A few seconds… that’s all you need!  At this point, you’re pretty sure even if you ran out of steam you’d still have enough of a lead to pull out a win.

But then… that wind picks up again.  The same one that knocked off all your clothes.  It’s stiff and bracing, sending a chill that creeps like icy tendrils along your body.  You ignore it.  No sexy fae is going to divert you from your goal!  

And yet… you *can’t* ignore it.  Because as the cool breeze wraps around you, it starts to effect a change.  All that sweat you’ve built up, that slick condensation on your skin, it begins to dry.  No – dry isn’t the right word.  Maybe it would be better to call it congeal.  It *hardens*.  All too late do you realize what your foe is trying to do.  And by the time it occurs to you, she has already succeeded.

Your perspiration forms a clear, glistening layer of your skin, almost like a lacquer, a shiny glaze, and as it cools, it also crackles and stiffens, traps and encases, freezing your muscles in place and preventing you from covering the last few feet to the goal.  You finally let go of your grip, holding your hands out to your sides as a look of confusion spreads along your features.  But there’s nothing you can do about it now.  And with an ominous *shwing* sound that echoes through the clearing, you petrify completely, becoming a glossy and gleaming statue beneath a lacquer magically formed from your own sweat and start to tip over.

Frozen as you are, you cannot stop yourself from clattering against the ground, making a dull, hollow *think* sound as you strike the grass.  Upon impact, you wobble ever so slightly, the stiffness of your tail serving as a fulcrum to make you vibrate for a few seconds before you come to a rest.  Stuck as you are, all you can do is stare forward as you watch the rest of the race play out without you.

Up ahead, Revissa’s equally shiny figure passes the finish line first, prompting a tinny fanfare to play from the merry-go-round’s speakers.  But you’re in no position to celebrate the win.  Because now you’re just as helpless as she is.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="181" name="FD06M" tags="" position="2725,1800" size="100,100">An idea strikes you as your muscles strain from the exertion of your plan.  At this point, Revissa is far enough ahead that even with the advantage of her ‘faster’ mount, the fae woman still wouldn’t be able to win.  At least, not unless she pulls another one of her tricks.  Which means your best bet for victory is to stop her from doing anything more to mess up your plan.  After all, if she’s able to strip you naked with a snap of her finger, what else could she do to disrupt you?

Better to disrupt her, first!  And so you let go of Revissa’s hand, instead reaching for the length of wire you had previously used to even the odds.  With a dextrous tug, you loosen the knots around Revissa’s half, then follow it up with a pull to free the fae woman’s mount from the loop.

The woman raises an eyebrow as you go about your business, clearly interested in what you’re planning next.

“Well, it’s not quite horseback, and I’m no cowgirl… but I think I can still wrangle myself something nice,” you say with a smirk, spinning the loop of the lasso over your head, then tossing it towards your target.

“Ah,” your opponent says, disappointment evident in her voice.  “How boring.”

And then with a flick of her finger, a gust of wind kicks the lasso right back towards *you*!  Unable to move away in time, the wires collide with your body, somehow changing in shape and size to become thick bands of leather that wrap around your ankles, shins and thighs, catching your arms and restraining your wrists together behind your back, securing themselves below your breasts and around your shoulders to prevent any attempt at breaking free.  Another flick, and rubber ball shoots forward and presses itself between your lips, more bands shooting out of it to form a tight and secure gag that cuts off any sounds from your mouth besides some plaintive grunts.

Ahead of you, not-Skadi’s mount regains its advantage, managing to just barely catch up to Revissa as she glides past the finish line, ending literally neck and neck.  A tinny fanfare goes off from the merry-go-round’s loudspeaker, indicating that the race has ended in – you guessed it – a tie.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="182" name="FD07" tags="" position="3025,1275" size="100,100">Against all odds, you won.  It took every ounce of wit and ingenuity in your arsenal, as well as no small amount of good old-fashioned elbow grease.  After straining yourself so hard, you’re sweaty and exhausted, naked body glistening with perspiration.  Now that’s it’s finally over, you’re able to just flop over onto your back and catch your breath, looking up into the bright sky above you.

A face appears in front of you, the curvaceous fae leaning over your prone body.  “Lying down on the job?  When you have a victory party to attend?  For shame!”

You groan as you pick yourself up, immediately noticing the change in your surroundings.  Now in place of the merry-go-round is one of those three-tiered victory platforms, with three different heights for first, second, and third place.  At the lowest tier, you see the merry-go-round itself, somehow shrunken down to be about the size of a snow globe.  The fae woman cheerily hops up onto the second-place platform, then motions for you to climb to the top.

“Let’s just get this over with,” you mutter, pulling yourself up to take your spot as the first-place winner.

As you do, canned applause begins to ring out from around you, an invisible crowd cheering your victory.  You can’t help but be distracted by it.  Even the most humble of heroes enjoys being recognized for their talent every once in a while.

“And the winner is… Melfy!” says an unseen announcer, making the audience’s voices raise to a fever pitch.  “And now she is offered a golden trophy as her prize!”

Beside you, the fae woman holds out a gleaming golden chalice mounted on an award stand, pushing it towards you. (if: $faekiss is true)[For a moment, a pang of hesitation grips you.  This isn’t the prize you wanted, is it?  But then you meet the fae woman’s eyes, and your body recalls the softness of her touch, the intensity of her passion, and you fall into a dreamy daze.  What else is there to do but…

She claps you on the back, making a light squeaking noise against your stiff, glossy body.

“You and your friends are so very resourceful, you know.  Always pulling out impossible wins in the final moment.  I’ve been keeping track of your exploits for a while now.  Ever since the four of you first teamed up.”

It feels like so long ago that you, Krysta, Vhaja, and Lumina crossed paths.  Went on adventures together.  Like she said, there were a lot of close calls.  There were plenty of times you nearly ended up as trophies for some villain or another.  But you’re starting to get a creeping suspicion that this might be the time it happens for real.

“So, as promised, it’s time for me to give you a prize.  I’ll go ahead and make a suggestion for what you can win, and if you don’t like it, just suggest something different, alright?”

“..........” 

With your lips frozen beneath the shiny lacquer, you can’t make a sound, one way or another.  

“So, how about this.  As a prize for being the winner, I’ll keep your lovely wife as part of my merry-go-round for the rest of eternity, and you as my glossy little trophy for the same duration.  Neither of you will ever be freed without my express approval, and no one will ever be able to save you.  How does that sound?”

“...!” 

You try to yell out a protest, but the fae woman cannot hear you.

She pokes your nose playfully.  “Just say ‘no I do not accept these terms’ and I’ll come up with something better.  But while we’re pitching ideas… how about I also track down your other friends and add them to my collection as well?  Say something if you disagree.”

“........!”

“You’re sure?  All you need to do is say the words – otherwise I’ll assume you accept my proposal.”

“.......................!”

“Well, if you insist… very well.  The deal is agreed upon.  You and your wife shall now belong to me for the rest of time.  And I’ll go ahead and capture the rest of your merry crew as well!”

A terrible dread sits in to the pit of your stomach.  This is just about the worst outcome imaginable.  You continue trying to catch her attention, but you can’t move a muscle, can’t make a sound, can’t do anything but watch through the glaze coating your eyes as she looks towards the merry-go-round, still cheerily spinning along, even after the race has ended.  And then she holds out her hand and, through a trick of visual perspective, picks it up and holds it in her palm.  Now it’s the size of a snow globe, Revissa just one of many tiny figures trapped within its confines.

“More portable this way,” she says with a grin.  “The perfect size to sit on a shelf, right next to my sexy little bedroom toy, wouldn’t you say?”

You wouldn’t, but you can’t.  All you can do is stand there in silent contemplation, the light gleaning off of your inert figure.  After so many adventures, it’s all just resulted in this, caught by a cruel and wicked fae, powerless to stop her from doing the same to the rest of your friends. You’d have been better off being lost in that forest forever.  But instead, now you and Revissa are both just two more playthings in the collection of an impossibly powerful being.

And with another snap of her fingers, you vanish from the forest, never to return again.

And you can’t overpower the grip of the taut, firm bands holding you tightly in place.  You’re caught.  Completely and utterly.  There’s nothing you can do but writhe helplessly, fruitlessly pushing against the bindings that have entrapped you with such absolute precision.

“Well then,” says the fae woman, walking over to inspect your helpless form, “it seems like we’ve ended the match in a tie.”

She snaps her finger, causing a line of wire to snake down and loop around the binds at your ankles, then yank upwards to hoist you upside down into the air.  More leather bands dart outwards from the sides to secure you against some support poles.  Now you can’t even squirm, held taut from every possible side.

You continue grunting into your gag, but she ignores your continued protests as she looks towards the merry-go-round, still cheerily spinning along, even after the race has ended.  And then she holds out her hand and, through a trick of visual perspective, picks it up and holds it in her palm.  Now it’s the size of a snow globe, Revissa just one of many tiny figures trapped within its confines.

“More portable this way,” she says with a grin.  “The perfect size to sit on a shelf, right next to my sexy little bedroom toy, wouldn’t you say?”

You wouldn’t, but you can’t.  Tears creep at the corners of your eyes as you realize just how helpless you are, just how completely you’ve been defeated.  Revissa was right - never trust a fae.  You’d have been better off wandering lost in that forest forever.  But instead, now you’re both just two more playthings in the collection of an impossibly powerful being.

And with another snap of her fingers, you vanish from the forest, never to return again.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="185" name="FD07D" tags="" position="3125,1675" size="100,100">You arrive in a strange, unfamiliar place, a location stuck outside of time.  It has the overall appearance of a curio shop, shelves lining the walls, antiques filling out every table.  On one wall, a giant grandmother clock.  Hanging from the ceiling, model airplanes suspended on strings.  In the center of the floor, a marble birdbath.  And yet, upon closer inspection, everything within the room has a macabre secret to it - because every single one hides the form of a helpless woman, trapped or transformed by the fae’s wicked magic.  Behind the glass of the clock, a tsunojian is shackled in place, the pendulum tick-tocking between her two heaving breasts.  And within the seats of the airplanes are tiny, glossy pilots, kemomi women shrunken and transformed to forever operate the controls.  And the basin of the birdbath, of course, is clutched between the fingers of a petrified elvaan, the placid smile etched onto her face belying the terror she must have felt in the moment her fate was sealed.

It is to the back of the room where you are taken, behind a curtain that conceals a small living quarters, a bed, a bookshelf, a writing desk, a nightstand.  Revissa’s tiny merry-go-round is set down on a small pedestal right beside the bed, perfectly slotting into the circular surface, almost like it was built to house her.  It probably was.  

(if: $faebound is true)[As for you, your bound and gagged form is slotted into a nice little nook right between the bookshelf and a dresser, firmly anchored in place in such a way as to provide not even an inch of wiggle room for your struggles.](else-if: $faeshiny is true )[As for you, your glossy form is nestled into a little nook right between the bookshelf and the dresser, mounted on a small stand complete with display hook that snaps around your ankle to hold you in place.](else-if: $faetrophy is true )[As for you, your trophy is set down on top of the bookshelf, giving you a clear view of the room and its contents.

“There we are,” says the smugly grinning fae, appreciating how the two of you add to the ambience of the room.  “But… it’s still missing something.  Hold on - I’ll be right back!”

And then she is gone in a puff of smoke once more.  You can’t tell how long she’s gone.  It could be a minute, it could be years.  Time seems to have no meaning here.  But when she returns, she has more items to add to the decor.

The first is a small, flat, rectangular object - a playing card?  No, it’s more than that.  The fae woman makes sure to hold it up to the light so that you can get a good look at it - at what’s trapped inside.  Within the holographic gleam of the card you can see Lumina’s image, etched onto its surface, eyes wide, arms pressed up against the image as if she were trying to escape.  But there’s no way she’ll be able to get out.  None of you can.  The fae slips the card inside a protective plastic sleeve, then tucks it into a binder that she files away in the bookcase.]

After that, she moves to her desk, flicking a finger to produce a heavy-looking golden object, maybe about six inches tall, rectangular on all sides.   An ornate paperweight.  She uses it to pin down some documents sitting there, really letting the light glean off of its gilded surface.  Only when she spins it can you see the figure embedded, four times, on each flat surface of the object.  It’s Vhaja.  A look of mute confusion is forever marked onto her face, her arms and legs neatly held at her sides so she can fit into the requisite surface area. All her talent and skill seems to have been useless to prevent her capture.]

Next, the fae woman moves to her bed.  She sits down atop the sheets, testing the springiness of the mattress, the fluffiness of the pillows.  Before she reaches into thin air and extracts an adorable little plush doll to nestle in against the headboard.  Krysta.  She’s in human form, wearing her street clothes and not her Star Scout uniform, big, brown eyes nothing more than felt decorations on her stuffed head.  Perhaps to taunt her, the collector tilts her head so she is looking towards the bookcase where her angelic lover is trapped.  There’s nothing she can do to enact a rescue - she can’t even save herself, trapped as she is.]

And then, finally, she slinks to the nightstand.  One more time, she flicks her hand, and one more time she produces the helpless form of one your crew.  Jyumon’s body is about eight inches tall, made of hard plastic, molded into a glossy sheen.  She’s wearing the outfit of a popular holo-game character whose name you can’t remember, noteworthy for her rather… generous proportions.  She fills out the costume well.  The fae sets her down onto the nightstand, tilting her so she looks towards the writing desk, though there is no change in the expression on her face as she holds the same saucy pose she is trapped in, folding fan jauntily clutched between her inert fingers.

“There we are!” she says with a bright smile.  “Perfect!  All our little heroes, trapped forever in one place.  I couldn’t just pick one or two - I had to go for the whole set!”

She does a little twirl, before leaning in towards your face, poking you in the nose.

“And I do mean forever.  There’s no getting out of this one, my lovely little toy.  No last-minute rescue.  All of you are mine.  And will remain mine, until I decide to let you go.  But let’s be honest… such a lovely collection as this one, I don’t see that happening any time soon.”

There’s nothing you can do.  You’re trapped, helpless.  Revissa is a glossy merry-go-round seat.  Lumina’s a holographic card, Vhaja’s a paperweight, Krysta’s a plush doll, and Jyumon a glossy model figure.  They won’t be saving you, and you won’t be saving them.  You messed with a fae, and now you’ve paid the price.

Three more silver statues in a row beside you, all lined up evenly with yourself.  She sure to give you a good look at each one of them before she sets them in place, letting you see fully the fates of your dearest friends.

“I’ve always been more partial to the original foursome,” she explains, setting Krysta down right beside you.  Your best friend stands in gleaming relief on her trophy platform, holding her trademark ice blaster pistol in one hand, and slinging her pet weasel Knocker over the other.  The engraving on her platform reads “Boobie Prize”, perhaps hinting at the competition she failed to end up like this.  If the fae woman appeared to her in the same form as she did to you, it’s easy to imagine the red-head getting tempted by her impressive bust and falling into a trap.  Whatever the circumstances, her big brown eyes can only dart back and forth as she suffers for her folly.]

Next comes Vhaja, always your must trusted confidant.  Her naked figure sways slightly at the hips, arms raised above her head, long hair braids dangling behind her.  Bright green eyes flicker with intense thought, desperately trying to conjure up some plan that will get the lot of you out of this mess.  She’d always had such an analytic mind.  The marking on her pedestal reads “Science Fair” - perhaps she was roped into a quiz show of some sort, or was forced to solve an engineering problem.  EIther way, it’s clear she failed.  And now that brilliant mind of hers is trapped in a body that cannot ever act on any of the plans she concocts.]

And finally comes Lumina.  The curvaceous angel is frozen as if in mid-takeoff, her legs perched on her trophy stand, arms extend, wings flaring out behind her.  Her purple eyes radiate confusion and worry, expressing bewilderment at how she’s ended up here as nothing but a collectible.  What kind of game did the fae play with her?  Her engraving reads “Best Girl”... what could it mean?  Perhaps she was offered the chance to be reunited with her partner, always the faithful lover, but did not expect that the cunning fae would turn her into a trophy as well as a result.

Whatever the circumstances, the lot of you are here, and you are trapped. And once your captor is certain you’re all aware of each other’s presence, she slinks to the nightstand.  One more time, she flicks her hand, and one more time she produces the helpless form of one your crew.]

And she does seem to enjoy those encounters.  But you start to notice that, as the ages flow by, every time she draws near you, she grows increasingly irate.  Testy, irritable.  You can’t for the life of you imagine why - it’s not like you have any agency at all to influence her mood.  But one day she comes out and says it.  What feels like a lifetime ago, you sucked down a Star Scout homing beacon, and ever since you’ve been captured it’s been sending out pulses into the void.  Useless to attract help, but effective in creating an obnoxious ringing in her ear.  Because the Scouts are formed around the tenets of love and happiness, even her fae magic can’t just undo the signal.  So she just tries to live with it.  But eventually, the benefit of keeping you outweighs the annoyance.

All at once, you and your friends appear in a naked pile in the middle of a remote planet.  No gear, no equipment, no idea how long you’ve been gone, or how you’ll make your way back to civilization.  She doesn’t care - she just wants to put an end to the incessant ringing.  Then she vanishes in her signature puff of smoke, leaving your party to their own devices.

What follows is an exciting adventure in its own right, but it’s not the adventure we’re here to tell today.  And, regardless, your actions have led to failing your original mission.  Maybe next time you’ll think better about getting tangled up with a fae.

You can’t for the life of you imagine why - it’s not like you have any agency at all to influence her mood.  But one day she comes out and says it.  What feels like a lifetime ago, you sucked down a Star Scout homing beacon, and ever since you’ve been captured it’s been sending out pulses into the void.  Useless to attract help, but effective in creating an obnoxious ringing in her ear.  Because the Scouts are formed around the tenets of love and happiness, even her fae magic can’t just undo the signal.  So she just tries to live with it.  But eventually, the benefit of keeping you outweighs the annoyance.

All at once, you and your friends appear in a naked pile in the middle of a remote planet.  No gear, no equipment, no idea how long you’ve been gone, or how you’ll make your way back to civilization.  She doesn’t care - she just wants to put an end to the incessant ringing.  Then she vanishes in her signature puff of smoke, leaving your party to their own devices.

What follows is an exciting adventure in its own right, but it’s not the adventure we’re here to tell today.  And, regardless, your actions have led to failing your original mission.  Maybe next time you’ll think better about getting tangled up with a fae.

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="192" name="FD07E" tags="" position="3150,1275" size="100,100">Overwhelmed by everything that is happening around you, your fingers wrap around the handles of the trophy, and you pull it from the fae woman’s grip.  As soon as you do, you feel a strange ripple in the space around you, as if something kind of intangible truth has just been locked into place.  It makes you shiver in fear for a moment, but then you lock eyes with the woman and any doubts melt away from your mind.

“As a golden trophy,” the announcer voice says, cutting through the din of the cheering crowd.  “Melfy will be the eternal property of the second-place winner.  She will have no power, no agency, and will be forever nothing more than a collectable knick-knack, to be done with as her owner pleases.”

Wait… what?  You didn’t agree to that!  You’re supposed to win the prize, not become it!  And yet, as if in a trance, you smile broadly, holding your arms over your head and flexing to the delight of the invisible crowd.

“Of course, our winner will be joined by her wife, who shall remain trapped forever as a glossy merry-go-round horse.  They will be part of the same collection, protected by their new owner for the rest of their days.”

No… no!  You don’t want this!  But you’re powerless to resist it now, the spell is too strong.  You’ve become completely overwhelmed by the cheering, the fanfare.  And now you feel your body starting to stiffen, your powerful muscles turning numb.

“In addition, the second-place winner will make every effort to hunt down and capture all of our champion’s companions as well, trapping them with similar games that they can’t ever hope to win at!”

This isn’t what you wanted… this isn’t fair!  You won!  You beat her!  And yet, your frozen body begins to shrink, the world around you seeming to pull away higher and higher.  You can’t stop it from happening.  You can’t resist.  Can’t do anything but stand there with that stupid smile stuck on your face, as the numbness spreads to your neck.

“And once all six of them are defeated, they will be entered into a collection and put on display forevermore, with no hope of rescue!”

A single tear dribbles down from your eye as the numbness eclipses your face.  And then… you become the prize you were fighting for.

Now you’re nothing but a golden trophy, claimed by the person you thought you had defeated.  If only you’d tried harder to resist the siren’s call that victory tempted you with.  (if: $faekiss is true)[Perhaps if you hadn’t tackled the fae woman to the ground and rolled in the hay with her, you’d have had enough mental fortitude to choose something else than what you’ve now found yourself stuck in.]  But it doesn’t matter now.  All that matters is that the game is over - and despite winning, you still feel like a loser.  

“Well, that was fun,” says the fae woman, now easily five or six times your size.  She wraps her hands around your golden midsection and brings you up in front of her face so she can inspect you from all sides.  “I hope you enjoyed it too.  And now you get the prize of belonging to me forever, along with all of your friends.  A pretty good deal, wouldn’t you say?”

You wouldn’t, but you can’t.  All you can do is stand there in silent contemplation, the light gleaming off of your inert figure.  After so many adventures, it’s all just resulted in this, caught by a cruel and wicked fae, powerless to stop her from doing the same to the rest of your friends. You’d have been better off being lost in that forest forever.  But instead, now you and Revissa are both just two more playthings in the collection of an impossibly powerful being.

And with another snap of her fingers, you vanish from the forest, never to return again.

No… there’s something not right here.  You won the game, you should be happy!  And yet… you feel the fur on your tail standing on end.  What is it Revissa always says - never trust a fae, never accept their gifts.  Well one is trying to give you something right now.  But you’re not having it.

With a powerful swipe of your arms, you knock the proffered trophy from the woman’s grip, sending it careening to the ground.  The moment it strikes the earth, the cheering stops, the victory platform vanishes, and the tiny merry-go-round containing your frozen wife appears in your hands.

“Well, that’s no fun,” says the fae lady with an adorable pout, pressing her sultry body up against you playfully.  “Are you *sure* you don’t want to be my sexy little trophy?  I’d take such good care of you!”

You slip out of her grasp.  “I’m gonna have to pass, sorry.  As my prize for winning, I demand you return Revissa back to normal.”

She frowns, but then holds up her hand as an idea strikes her.  “Now hold on… before you go asking for any prizes, I have an offer for you.”

“Not interested.”

“Ugh, just listen!  This one’s *really* spicy.”  She appears behind you, pressing her soft chest against your back.  “Why don’t we play one more game.  A very simple one.  If I win… I get to keep you, of course.  But if *you* win… you get to keep *me*.”

That at least gives you pause.  

“I get to keep you?”

“That’s right.  You can trap me however you like, and I’ll be yours.  Up until you die – or until your fate is sealed by someone else.”

Okay, this is obviously another trick.  One last bit of temptation to try and trap you in her web of lies.  And yet… the feeling of her bosom pressed against you is so tantalizing, the way her warm breath brushes against your ears, her hands gently massaging the muscles of your arm.  It *would* be nice to keep her… if only to remove such a dangerous being from causing any more mischief.  And after all, you already managed to win one of her games - who’s to say you can’t win another?

[[Play another game-&gt;FD08]]
[[Resist the temptation-&gt;FD09]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="194" name="FD08" tags="" position="3025,1950" size="100,100">This is stupid.  You *know* this is stupid.  After how far you’ve come avoiding getting caught by her, it’s utterly bonkers to throw yourself into another one of her games.  But like it or not, you’ve fallen under her spell.  The temptation to have her for yourself is just too great to ignore.

“Alright… I’m in.  Let’s play another game.”

She actually looks surprised at your decision.  “Really?  Wow, I can’t believe that worked.  You didn’t even ask what the game would be!  But it’s too late to back out now!”

You know it was a stupid choice, but you don’t really appreciate her rubbing it in like that.

“So… first, the stakes.  If I lose, you get to keep me for the rest of your life, in whatever form you choose.  And if *I* win… I get to keep you.  And your wife.  And I’ll track down your friends and keep them, too.”

“...wait!  I never agreed to that!”

“You agreed to a game without even hearing the rules.  What did you expect?”

This was, admittedly, an incredibly dumb choice on your part.  But what’s done is done, so now you just have to win.

“So… what *is* the game, then?”

“Oh, it really is quite simple.  All you have to do to win… is speak my name.”

You blink in confusion.  That’s it?  But wait… how could you possibly know her name?

“Err… but I don’t know your name,” you say lamely.

“Indeed.  Quite the conundrum you find yourself in.  Anyway, you have ten seconds.  Get it right, or be mine forever.  So, what’s it gonna be, wolfie?”

[[Take a guess-&gt;FD08A]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="195" name="FD09" tags="" position="2325,2550" size="100,100">You shake your head.

“No dice.  Turn my wife back and leave us alone.  That’s what I want.”

The fae woman pouts.  “You’re sure?”

For a brief moment, you’re gripped by a pang of anxiety.  Are you somehow making the wrong choice?  Is this another trick?  Were you supposed to say something else, some magic words that would actually get her to do what you want?  But you bite your doubts down.  No one ever survived an encounter with a fae by being indecisive.

“Yes, I’m sure.  Return Revissa to normal.”

“Ugh, fine.  Maybe you’re not as fun as I thought.”

She snaps her fingers, and the tiny merry-go-round in your hand starts to spin, whirling faster and faster until one of the ‘horses’ shoots out and smashes into you.  And when you look up, Revissa is laying on top of you, hale and hearty.  You throw your arms around her and hold her tight.  What follows is a kiss more passionate than anything in recent memory.

“I told you… never trust a fae,” she says when you finally come up for air.

“I could sue you for discrimination, you know,” says the woman, poking her face between the two of you.

Revissa bats her away.

“Oh, I know - you’re still lost, aren’t you?  I can help guide you –”

“No!” you and your wife shout in unison.

The woman throws up her hands.

“Fine then.  Enjoy the scenery, I guess!  And remember - don’t always believe everything you see or hear!”

And then, mercifully, she’s gone.  The best way to beat a fae is to make them lose interest in you.  It seems like you’ve finally succeeded.  

The two of you have something of a tradition when it comes to barely escaping nigh-insurmountable peril.  And the two of you engage in it now.  It involves your bodies getting even closer to one another than they already are, and a whole lot of kissing.  On the lips and other places.  After thirty minutes you lay beside each other, naked and panting on the grass.   In a minute you’ll put your clothes back on and continue exploring, but for the moment you’re just happy to be together.

But there’s still a mission to complete, and a forest ahead of you that defies all attempts to navigate it.  You got lost once before, and nearly drowned in a tar pit for your efforts.  Only thanks to the fae woman’s intervention were you able to escape the first time.  Without her, will you be able to survive a second?

Maybe it would be better to turn around now and try a different path through the woods, one which is easier to navigate.  It would be a huge waste of time, but better late to complete the mission than never, right?

You have no way of knowing if that fae woman herself was responsible, or if there’s some other force at play here that wants to hamper the success of your mission.  But for now, all you can do is keep moving forward.

[[Keep going-&gt;FD02]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="198" name="FD09D" tags="" position="2625,2700" size="100,100">You’re not going to turn back now, not after everything you’ve been through.  Yes, you’re still not fully sure how to navigate the forest, but that seems like such a quaint complication after the insanity you’ve lived through.  It’s not every day you have a merry-go-round race on your wife’s back, after all.

And so, gathering up your equipment… and your courage, you begin to walk.  Revissa follows dutifully alongside you, vigilant against any more unwanted intrusion from fairies, trees, and monsters.  You keep your eyes glued to your map screen for the first hour or so, but eventually, you’re forced to admit that it still isn’t working this deep in.  Whatever lured you into that tar pit is still around here, still holds claim over the twisting passages of trees.

But that’s fine.  You’re feeling more confident now, more sure of yourself.  Maybe the map isn’t working, but you still have your innate sense of direction, complications be damned!  And as you walk, you think about what the fae woman said before she parted ways - don’t trust your eyes or your ears.  Fair enough.  So instead, you’ll trust your mind and your heart.  You keep walking, recklessly, arrogantly assuming you know what you’re doing, never once looking down at the map.  And against all odds, it seems to work.  Because as you barrel past yet another identical cluster of bushes, your comm device makes a pleasant beep to let you know you’re approaching the destination you had programmed into it.

It should have been a moment of triumph, but at the exact same instant, you happen to hear something else.  Claws scraping against dirt, a low growl, leaves rustling as a predator approaches.  Already running on instinct, you clutch your sword and wheel around towards the threat without stopping to think whether it’s a good idea.

[[Lay eyes on the threat-&gt;FD09DA]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="199" name="FD09DA" tags="" position="2800,2675" size="100,100">There are a lot of benefits that come with experience.  You’ve gone on so many adventures, endured so much, suffered defeat and felt the thrill of victory more times than you can count.   And because of that, your instincts have been honed to a razor sharp edge, letting you pick up on danger where other women would have continued on unawares.

Usually, that experience is a good thing.  Normally, reacting quickly can save your life.  Sadly, this time, it proves to have the opposite effect.  Because as you wheel around, you find yourself looking right into the eyes of a large, squat, bulky lizard with vibrant scales the same pastiche of colors as the leaves crumpled up on the ground.  

That trained mind of yours, honed by years of instinct, warns you of the threat you now face a micro-second before your body begins to seize up.  You have just enough time to start to recoil, for your eyes to widen, for your lips to part and for a warning to begin to form on your tongue.  The warning never escapes your lips before your face turns to granite.

What you’ve discovered, creeping up on you in the brush, is a basilisk.  A creature known for its ability to turn flesh to stone as soon as one meets its gaze.  In a universe where you were less perceptive, you might have been better off.  But that’s not the universe you currently occupy.

If there’s any mercy, it’s that the transformation is shockingly swift.  Your ears have a moment to register the telltale crackling sound, your muscles have the opportunity to feel how swiftly they are stiffening.  And your eyes have a blissful few seconds to register the bright yellow pupils of the monster that entrapped you, before they become little more than blank, sightless orbs.

Given how many adventures you’ve made it through, this would be a rather ignominious way to end one.  But as your clothing turns brittle and crumples away, and your mind falls into a deep, dreamless sleep, you realize with your last gasp of consciousness that life is not always fair.  The greatest of stories can end in a heartbeat with one mistimed step.  And it seems yours has met just such an unsatisfying conclusion.

You were standing before, but now you’re on your back, looking up at the canopy of branches above as Revissa leans over you with an expression equal parts relieved and annoyed.

“Well… I’m glad these things work,” she says, slipping one of Lumina’s celestially charged healing diamonds back into her pouch.

“I was…” you begin groggily.

“Rock hard, yes.  I always loved how firm your abs were, but this was a bit much.”

You rub your head wearily, making use of muscles that had been rendered utterly stiff for several hours.

“The… monster?  I saw it, I–”

Revissa chuckles.  “I scared it off.  It wasn’t really dangerous, probably just protecting its territory.”

Lucky for you it wasn’t.  And that you were being so much more aggressive in your movements and reactions than Revissa was.  If you’d both looked at it at the same time… well, there wouldn’t have been anyone around to use that healing diamond.

Either way, you’re alive now, and not just a hunk of stone.  And you’ve made it far enough into the forest that your destination is but a stone’s throw away.  Your clothes were destroyed when you were petrified, but the use of one of Jyumon’s matter re-synthesizer capsules gives you an exact duplicate of your outfit, meaning that once you do some stretches to work out the last gasps of stiffness from your muscles, you’re good to go.

The fae woman frowns.

“Yeah… so here’s the thing.  This is gonna be a really fun sequence, and it would be great if I had a lot of unique things to say based on your guesses, but that’s a whole lot of effort.  So for now, I’m sorry to say, there was no way to win this game, even if you *did* somehow guess right.”

You ball up your fists in anger.  “What?  But that’s not fair!”

The fae woman shrugs.  “Blame the author.  Though to be fair, I get it.  Writing all this dialogue must be exhausting.  But yeah, sorry to say, in this beta release, this section is going to remain incomplete.”

“Well, crap.  So… what, do we just go back, or…?”

She laughs.  “No, of course not.  We’re going to play out the Bad End where I keep you and your friends forever.  You still deserve a reward for your poor choices, after all.  So…”

“Wait, no, hold on–”

Something heavy and firm is pressed against your back, and leather straps dig painfully into your bare skin.  You open your eyes and find yourself looking out onto the floor of a strange, unfamiliar place, a location stuck outside of time.  It has the overall appearance of a curio shop, shelves lining the walls, antiques filling out every table.  On one wall, a giant grandmother clock.  Hanging from the ceiling, model airplanes suspended on strings.  In the center of the floor, a marble birdbath.  And yet, upon closer inspection, everything within the room has a macabre secret to it - because every single one hides the form of a helpless woman, trapped or transformed by the fae’s wicked magic.  Behind the glass of the clock, a tsunojian is shackled in place, the pendulum tick-tocking between her two heaving breasts.  And within the seats of the airplanes are tiny, glossy pilots, kemomi women shrunken and transformed to forever operate the controls.  And the basin of the birdbath, of course, is clutched between the fingers of a petrified elvaan, the placid smile etched onto her face belying the terror she must have felt in the moment her fate was sealed.

You feel intense sympathy for all the captured women on display throughout the floor.  Because you, like them, are now a prisoner.  

“Well, girls?  How does it feel?” the fae whose name is not Skadi asks.  “Comfy?”

You wish you knew what to call her.  If you had, you wouldn’t be in this situation right now.  None of you would be.

The last thing you remember, you were in the forest.  And you and Revissa were the only ones victimized by the sultry trickster’s machinations.  But now, all of you are part of her collection.  Between each of your lips, a rubber ball gag, snugly sealing off your voices.  Around your limbs, thick, restrictive leather bands, binding you against a wooden display board mounted on the wall.  You’ve been made out to be hunting trophies.  Though in a sense, that’s what you all are.  Because you *were* hunted, you *were* caught, and now you *are* helpless to do anything but squirm.

“So, some ground rules.  The bindings are magical, of course.  So even our slippery red-headed friend here will have no chance of wiggling out.  They’re… conceptual, rather than physical, the *idea* of leather straps.  Struggle all you want, you will never make the tiniest bit of headway in getting free.

She gives Krysta an affectionate squeeze on the rump before moving on.

“Second, you’re in my home realm now, so you won’t ever age, won’t ever grow hungry or tired, and won’t ever come to any harm.  Well, not unless you consider being my toy harmful.”

Her fingers brush through Lumina’s feathers.

“Third, you are mine now.  In a metaphysical sense.  The universe sees you as my property.  Don’t try to wrap your pretty little heads around it, you wouldn’t be able to understand.  Not in the way I do.  Because you see, I exist at a higher level than the rest of you, I can see the story and how it ends.  And it ends with all of you, here, in this place, as part of my collection.  Forever.”

She walks up and strokes your tail with one hand, and massages Vhaja’s thigh with the other.

“Now you might be wondering - what about your lovely girlfriends?  Why aren’t they here on display with you?  Well, two reasons.  One - this commission already cost a lot as it was.  Such lovely art, by the way.  But two - because I consider you four the real protagonists, and those other two as bonuses.  Add-ons.  An expansion pack, if you will.  But that doesn’t mean I haven’t caught them, and it doesn’t mean they can’t spend eternity mounted up on a wall, just like you four.”

A snap of her finger, and two more additions appear in the room.]

On one wall is Jyumon, naked, encased in a clear plastic vacbed, limbs splayed awkwardly as she looks out at the room, sees the four of you, realizes the fate you’ve found yourselves in.  She and Vhaja lock eyes, exchanging helpless, defeated glances.  They know enough about the magical world to know there’s no escaping when a fae this powerful has her hands on you.

“And, of course, the lovely deer… though goodness, we should get new art of her.  That old design really doesn’t do her cuteness justice, does it?”]

Revissa is encased in freezium and mounted above a lit fireplace, a lock of shock etched onto her face.  Sadly, you and she can not exchange despondent looks, because she is fully inert, trapped in stasis, unconscious (you hope).  Perhaps she’s the lucky one.

“So yes, there you go.  All of you are here, all of you are mine, and none of you will ever escape.  No rescue is coming, not here, not in my place of power.  No salvation, no silver lining, no last-minute heroics.  This is the end for all of you.  I win, you lose.  And all because a silly little wolfie thought she could beat me at my own game.

She squeezes one of your breasts lovingly, then leans in close.

“Here in the final release of the game, I would give you a cryptic hint about how you could follow a trail of clues to figure out my name.  Because even we fae need to play by rules - there needs to always be a *chance* that our victims can win.  The magic doesn’t *work* otherwise.  But it’s only ever a chance, and that chance doesn’t need to be fair.  And it doesn’t always need to be *now*.  Maybe in an update or two, this will be programmed better.  But for now…”

And now she steps away, looking her new prizes over one last time.

“I bid you adieu.  I have more cuties to catch, more heroes to pluck from more timestreams to add to my gallery.  So until next we meet… don’t go anywhere!”

The echoes of her laughter linger in the room far after she vanishes, leaving you all alone with the rest of her collection.

Mostly all you do is sit there as nothing but a trophy, a toy.  You and your friends attracted the attention of an otherworldly being with unimaginable power, and now all of you are nothing but baubles for her collection.  Though as the years passes on, it becomes clear that you, for whatever reason, are her favorite.

Sure, every once in a while she’ll lovingly stroke Lumina’s wings, or trace a finger along the length of Vhaja’s long, pointed ear.  Krysta gets a peck on the cheek, a squeeze on the rump as she passes by, treated with the same amount of interest as a painting hanging from the wall. Sometimes she might take a cloth and polish Revissa’s inert body, or spray some cleaning solution on the clear plastic casing keeping Jyumon sealed away, making sure there’s no errant smudges.  But it’s you that gets to have ‘fun’.

Every once in a while, the fae gets that lusty look in her eyes, and decides to make use of you as something more than a decoration.  She’ll start with her fingers deftly slipped between your lower lips, churning away until you reach a point of helpless distraction.  And while you’re dazed, she’ll pull down your display stand off the wall and set it on the floor, lowering herself on top of your face and grinding herself to completion.  At no point do any of your bindings loosen even an iota.  In a way, you feel guilty, because it’s the only thing you have to look forward to breaking the monotony of your existence, and it’s apparently an honor reserved only for you.  When the woman is finished, she leaves her slick residue staining your body, putting you back on display so all your friends can see what your purpose is.

Her attention is the one distraction from an otherwise bland eternity of helplessness, with you and your crew doomed to spend eternity in her collection.  No rescue ever comes.  No mercy is ever given.  You’re just toys to her, and toys you shall remain.  

Forever.

When the woman is finished, she leaves her slick residue staining your body, putting you back on display so all your friends can see what your purpose is.

And she does seem to enjoy those encounters.  But you start to notice that, as the ages flow by, every time she draws near you, she grows increasingly irate.  Testy, irritable.  You can’t for the life of you imagine why - it’s not like you have any agency at all to influence her mood.  But one day she comes out and says it.  What feels like a lifetime ago, you sucked down a Star Scout homing beacon, and ever since you’ve been captured it’s been sending out pulses into the void.  Useless to attract help, but effective in creating an obnoxious ringing in her ear.  Because the Scouts are formed around the tenets of love and happiness, even her fae magic can’t just undo the signal.  So she just tries to live with it.  But eventually, the benefit of keeping you outweighs the annoyance.

All at once, you and your friends appear in a naked pile in the middle of a remote planet.  No gear, no equipment, no idea how long you’ve been gone, or how you’ll make your way back to civilization.  She doesn’t care - she just wants to put an end to the incessant ringing.  Then she vanishes in her signature puff of smoke, leaving your party to their own devices.

What follows is an exciting adventure in its own right, but it’s not the adventure we’re here to tell today.  And, regardless, your actions have led to failing your original mission.  Maybe next time you’ll think better about getting tangled up with a fae.

(if: $treetalk is true)[Instead, you just wonder why it was that the ‘helpful’ tree wanted to lead you into a trap.  Maybe your presence had disturbed it.  Maybe you were too loud, too disrespectful of the forest.  Or maybe it just thought it would be funny to doom you to a life of captivity at the hands of an, admittedly, super gorgeous spider-babe.  You have to admit, there are decidedly worse ways to get kidnapped.  And you should know, you’ve been kidnapped in practically every way imaginable.](else: )[Instead, you just wonder what these women are even doing here.  They can’t possibly be natives to this planet – during your briefing it had been made clear there was no sapient life present.  So then what?  Smugglers?  Pirates?  Why this planet?  Why now?  And… what are they going to do with you, now that they’ve got you.  The woman dragging you away provides no answers.]

Once she finds a good spot, she plops you down on the ground with your back against the cavern wall, then anchors you in place with more webbing.  You strain hard against the taut lines of silk, but don’t move an inch.  You’re not going anywhere.

“There we go,” she says brightly, poking your breast with a finger.  “The perfect bait.”

Bait?  Your heart sinks as you realize what the purpose of all this is.  She skitters over and sets down something on a rock right beneath you - your comm device.  You can see that she’s left a communication channel open, something that any of your friends would easily be able to trace, probably thinking you opened it on purpose to let them know where to find you.

“And now… we wait.  And five more delicious morsels will walk right into the kitchen.”

How could she know how many were on your crew for this mission?  Did she go through the data on your communicator?  (if: $treetalk is true)[Or… did the tree tell her that, too?](else: )[Did the other spider ladies do some recon to find out?]  You have no way to know.

Your captor stays close to you the whole time, occasionally occupying herself by groping and fondling your helpless body.  But eventually something seems to trigger her spider-senses, and she skitters off into the gloom to go hunting.  And then, twenty minutes later, she returns with two wriggling bundles, one slung over each arm.

(link:&quot;See who she&#39;s got&quot;)[(show:?drink1)]

(set: $picF43 to true)

Vhaja and Jyumon kick and buck, mewling into their gags, but only the faintest of moans escape the confines of the silk.  Just like you, you can tell all of their clothing has been peeled off beneath the webbing, the strands clinging firmly to the inviting contours of their bodies.  As much as you enjoy a bit of kinky web bondage, that’s a personal fetish, and not something you would willingly invite others to participate in without their consent.  Your friends had come to rescue you from a lifetime as the sexy spider’s plaything, and were captured themselves as a reward for their efforts.  It makes you feel like an absolute heel as the arachnid woman cheerily binds them in place nearby, tripling the yield of her catch.

Krysta is the next to show up.  She creeps through the gloom, stumbling upon your bound-up bodies.  And, thinking she’s about to play the hero, she pulls out her vibra-dagger, slinking toward you to cut your bonds - before a shadow descends from the cavernous ceiling and pins her to the ground.  A minute later and she’s mummified in silk like the rest of you.

Hearing her cry of surprise, Lumina glides out from the end of the cavern, cleric staff in hand, but she slams into a tangle of silk strewn across the pathway before even getting a single spell off.  The spider woman takes her time gleefully peeling away her clothing, forcing you all to watch as she toys with her angelic body.]

(set: $picF44 to true)

Once she’s had her fill, she bundles Lumina up just like the rest of you, suspending her in the center of the cavern.  She wriggles weakly - all of you do - but the bonds are effectively unbreakable when you’re all wrapped up so tightly.  The most any of you can do is moan into the silk covering your lips, straining uselessly against the impossibly firm restraints.  It’s clear this spider woman is no novice at her craft.  She always makes sure to anchor all of you in place with an excess of tethers, keeping you from squirming around to find some sharp edge to potentially cut a hole in the white dresses she’s woven for you all.

“Five down, one to go!” she says brightly, leaving Lumina swaying like a hammock as she goes off in search of her last target.

You’d like to think Revissa put up a fight.  That she got off a few spells, or maybe transformed into a bear and got a good claw slash right across the spider lady’s face.  It’s a nice fantasy.  Because it would mean that the six of you weren’t just helpless prey, that you were heroes who had gone on countless adventures across the galaxy, the kind of people they’d write stories about.  That’s a much more comforting thought than the image of your wife being pounced on from the shadows, stripped, bound, gagged and dragged off in an instant.  So, even when the spider lady comes into view, carrying her helplessly wriggling body, you imagine you just missed the epic confrontation happening right out of frame.

But whatever the truth of their encounter was, it doesn’t change the reality of the situation you all find yourselves in now.  Completely and utterly defeated, wrapped up so tightly you can’t possibly hope to escape.  

“There we are cuties, all of you snug as bugs.  It was nice of you all to come visit!”

She gets a chorus of muffled grunts from her collection of captives, but she ignores them as she lines you all up and glues you to the walls of the cave.]

“And don’t worry, we’ll take wonderful care of the lot of you.  After all, this is a remote planet, so we’ll need some entertainment to keep up morale…”

The six of you exchange glances, hoping someone’s expression holds some degree of confidence, a solution to the problem you’ve found yourselves in.  But there’s no such luck.  Each of you are equally helpless, and each of you is equally doomed to submit to the spider-lady’s advances.  With the whole crew caught, there’s no prospect for rescue in sight, making clear that the arrangement she’s chosen for you is going to be a long-term one.

Most people in the galaxy have heard of the Spider Queens, the ruthless warlords who travel the stars in their massive dreadnaughts, scooping up all the women in unprotected colonies to add them to their hordes of wiggling slaves.  Pure-blooded queens are towering warriors, with the lower body of bulbous spiders and the upper torso of a beautiful woman.  

Well, the ladies who have caught you all call themselves Spider Princesses - the half-breed offspring of queens.  Generally without political power in the hierarchy of the queens, they’ve been gathered together on this planet by the woman who captured all of you, a charismatic leader named Tula.  She wants to unite the scattered princesses and form their own coalition, using the natural resources of this planet as an economic weapon to cement her power.  The key to her plan is Ghost Matter, the material everything on the planet is made of.  When spider women consume fruits made of the stuff, their silk inherits its properties, making their webs both much stronger and much better at putting the women wrapped in them in permanent stasis.  But of course, to entice people to her cause, she has to offer them benefits – which come in the form of year-round, all-day access to as many webbed-up sex toys as they want.  You and your crew are just the first batch.

And so, as Tula’s power grows, more and more cocooned captives are brought in to line the walls of the caverns, helpless slaves who serve no purpose other than to slake the endless sexual hunger of their owners.  The six of you, strung up in a major thoroughfare of the cliffside caverns, are in high demand as stress relievers.  Rare is the day you get even an hour of alone time when you’re not being played with by an endless parade of beautifully possessive half-breed monarchs.

Needless to say, none of you are ever freed.  You exist now as nothing more than public-use stimulation fixtures, an important part of the infrastructure of a growing galactic power.

It is only by pure chance that you don’t spend the rest of your lives cocooned in the caves.  A good thirty years after your capture, a Star Scout squadron here for entirely unrelated reasons happens to pick up your distress beacon from the candy you ate at the start of the mission.  By now, the planet is a bustling trade hub with its own government, so they can’t just break you free in a commando raid.  Instead, they negotiate for your release with diplomacy, and secure a promise that Scout members and their crews will spend no more than a hundred years in captivity.  Which means you’ve all got another seventy years to go, but hey, it’s better than nothing.

At the very least, it leaves you plenty of time to think on what you could have done differently to not end up where you are now.

Or at least, you can’t go on *this* mission naked.  There’s been more than one occurrence where you and Revissa had to accomplish something entirely in the buff, but that usually only happened after you were kidnapped and needed to fight your way out of custody.

Revissa gets dressed first.  Her color scheme is a mixture of green, white and gold, a simple cloth shirt that shows off her cute tummy, a very low-cut skirt that would leave some sensitive areas exposed if not for the leaf adornment near the hips, some functional leg-wraps made of material harvested from plants, and a long scarf tied around the neck.  The ensemble is completed with some beautifully lacquered wooden jewelry polished to a golden sheen, including a moth emblem meant to show her devotion to the ancient forest guardian Un-Rama, a powerful fae spirit that protects her people.  Her long wooden staff bears the same symbol on its tip, making it the perfect conduit for her nature magic.

You take your time appreciating her before you bother getting your own outfit on.  For years you used to prefer purely functional clothing, but a long time ago on a mission you had gone in disguise under the made-up persona of the Dread Captain Wolfe, notorious space pirate, and to be honest you had really dug the aesthetic.  And so despite not actually having ever resorted to anything akin to piracy, you still like to sport the look, if for no other reason than as a personal ego boost.]

The outfit consists of some form-fitting pants that really accentuate your shapely bum, complete with a slit at the back for your poofy tail to fit through, and an equally clingy top that highlights both your chest size and your toned and muscular abdomen.  Belt buckles keep your tight leather boots firmly secured, while also providing a place to hang an equipment pouch and a blaster pistol on your hips.  A dashingly heroic cape hangs from your shoulders, but it also serves to conceal the heavy sword you also keep fastened there in a sheath along your back.

To be perfectly honest, you look damn good.  You’ve still got it!  Revissa rolls her eyes as you appreciate yourself in the mirror for a bit too long, before she finally grabs you by the arm and leads you out into the hallway so you can meet up with the rest of the crew.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="213" name="FC02" tags="" position="2375,875" size="100,100">You decide that it would be useful to investigate the potential of settlers or explorers here in the forest.  Both because it would give Revissa someone to be angry at other than you for a change, but also because whoever’s here might have some useful information that could help you on your journey.  

Veering off from the river, you follow an easily visible trail into the trees, walking for only about five minutes until the path opens up into a large clearing.  Here you find a half-dozen prefabricated living structures arranged in a semi-circle around a medium-sized cargo ship, maybe twice as big as your Lucky Break.  The ship is parked with its landing struts out, and you get the sense that it’s been there for at least a week or so, based on little details like how the loading ramp is arranged.  Off to one side you spy more of that resin that had been pooled up from the tree fitted with a faucet, though now it’s been hardened into huge chunks of opaque amber about as tall as a person, maybe six to ten of them all scattered around a massive flower.  Near the tree line you see some kind of equipment set up, probably meant for harvesting and packaging resources being gathered from the forest, since there are also a good deal of shipping crates piled up next to it.

Altogether, it does look very much like a smuggler’s camp.  And you can guess at the culprits based on the model of the cargo ship - a Knottie design.  From your briefing you know that the Knotties had established a camp near the ruins, but it looks like their operations have recently expanded towards the forest.  (if: $sawbunny is true)[Thinking back on it, you *had* seen some Knottie women entrapped by the psychic bunny in the central part of the forest, so it stands to reason this outpost is where they originated from.]  That said, you don’t see any of them currently milling about.  Maybe they’re on the ship or in one of the buildings, or perhaps just out working in the woods.

“I can’t believe they would treat this beautiful forest as nothing more than a source of raw materials!” Revissa says with an honestly kind of adorable pout.

In your head, you take note that Revissa seemed entirely unconcerned with them gathering resources when it was near the ruins - she only cares about it when trees and plants and forests are involved.  But you smartly bite your tongue, lest that pout be directed towards you, instead.

“Well… I guess we should have expected it,” you say diplomatically.  “There’s lots of stuff you can find in a forest to turn into bondage gear.  Vines, plant fibers, spider silk… even animal leather.  It was bound to happen sooner or later.”

“We need to drive them out!” Revissa firmly declares.

It takes you a few minutes to convince her that even if you *did* drive them out, it’s not like you’re planning on staying permanently on the planet to keep them away from the trees.  Better to just take note of it, and maybe bring it up with Krysta later as a point of discussion during her negotiations at their main camp.  

Either way, now that you’re here, you may as well take a look around.  The scent of pollen is thick in the air here, giving you a slight headache as you start to explore.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="214" name="FC03" tags="" position="1625,725" size="100,100">The tapping of the tree certainly poses an interesting mystery.  And you sympathize with Revissa’s anger at the situation.  But at the end of the day, you’re not here to solve all this planet’s problems, or to stick your nose into places it doesn’t belong.  What you need is to place these data collection devices and fulfill your mission.  Besides, once all the devices are in place, maybe the information gathered can help answer all these other questions as well.

Revissa is not entirely happy with your choice, but she goes along with it anyway.  But as you continue along the side of the river, she is constantly reaching out with her druidic senses, trying to connect with the various trees and plants around you.  It slows you down, but you know better than to interrupt her when she’s concentrating so strongly.  However, as you pass by a particularly thick cluster of tangled roots and vines, she stops completely.

“Are you okay?” you ask, gently walking up and laying a hand on her shoulder.

She shakes her head.  “No, I… I feel an intense presence in the forest.  It’s… alive.  But more than alive.  There’s a consciousness to it… and it is calling out to me…”

You raise an eyebrow.  Mysterious consciousnesses in the forest are not exactly the most reassuring thing to encounter on a ghost planet, and you tell her as much.

“I know…” she says distantly.  “But… I feel a deep… yearning from it, I suppose.  A loneliness.  I think… I should go to it.  See what it wants.  I’m a druid, I owe it that much.”

She leaves unsaid her annoyance that you did not let her follow up on her previous impulse.  And this time, she doesn’t wait for you to tell her otherwise.  She turns away from the side of the river and walks forcefully into the thick tangle of plants to the side, not even looking back.  You stand there for a moment, flabbergasted, at a loss for what to do next.

[[Let her go-&gt;FC03A]]
[[Stop her-&gt;FC03B]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="215" name="FC01A" tags="" position="1775,1025" size="100,100">Your desires are impossible to resist!  Just looking at Revissa fills you with an indescribable warmth, one which you are compelled to satisfy in the only way you know how.  Almost without realizing it, you pounce, pushing your wife to the ground and pawing at her clothing, tearing fabric and sending boots flying every which way.

At first, she tries to keep her composure, push you away.  But after the first love bite on her exposed shoulder, she mewls with delight and closes her eyes, leaning in against you.

“That pollen… from before…” she mutters between gasps.  “It must have… been some sort of… slow-acting aphrodisiac…”

Her explanation falls on deaf ears.  Because the only sound you are searching for right now are passionate moans and delighted squeals.  And so you get to work on eliciting those beautiful noises, subjecting Revissa to all of your most effective love-making techniques.  She melts in your arms, falling to her knees as your hands satisfy every inch of her yearning skin.  And at one point, her pleasure is so great that she screams in ecstasy, unintentionally channeling some of her nature magic to cause the ground to rumble and the trees around you to spread their roots even more deeply.

In the long run, that will make the plants in the area stronger and healthier, more resistant to the weather.  But in the short term, it has a different effect.  Namely, causing the nearby tree with the faucet valve on it to erupt with life, causing a spray of glistening amber to burst out from the spigot right above the two of you.

Perhaps it would have been a good idea to spend some time investigating the properties of the honey-sweet sap, because if you had, you’d have found it remains a liquid for only a few seconds after being exposed to the air, before quickly hardening into a thick, impenetrable resin.  The two of you only have a moment to react with surprise before a globule of the amber has fully washed over you, forming a hunk of quick-drying honey that has encased your bodies from head to toe.

To be fair, the sensations are indescribable.  The scent of honey does not just fill your nostrils, it permeates your entire being, a heavenly sweetness that prompts an explosion of erotic surrations through your skin, your muscles, through every nerve ending.  And as it hardens into a glistening, translucent rock of unbreakable resin, you can only surrender to the torrent of orgasmic bliss that washes over you, a hundred times more potent than the best sex you’ve ever had in your life.

At this point, you can’t move.  You can’t breathe, though that doesn’t seem to matter.  You can vaguely perceive light shining in through the hunk of amber, but your mind isn’t in a state to really process it.  Because the sensations of pleasure do not abate.  Instead, they fill up to bursting, the most intensely erotic joy you’ve ever had.  And whether you like it or not, it doesn’t seem like it’s ever going to stop.

You are occasionally vaguely aware of changes in the environment outside your shell - of clouds passing over the sun, of rainfall, of animals hopping around your sap-hardened body.  But all of that hardly seems to matter.

The only thing that matters to you is the pleasure.  Day in and day out, that is your entire world, a thrumming intensity of sensation that never abates.  Your mind becomes consumed by it, your body turning into nothing but a conduit of pure stimulation, every ounce of your being focused on the constantly churning tsunami of sexual buildup.  There’s never any release to it, no downhill trajectory, no moment to catch your breath.  Everything is pleasure, to the exclusion of anything else.

Presumably, your crew is still out there somewhere.  Maybe they got caught by some other peril on the planet, or maybe they were forced to abandon it after weeks of searching.  There’s no way to know.  The only thing that’s certain is that no one ever finds you, no one ever arrives to put an end to your eternal happiness.  Though, to be fair, with your mental state as it is, you’d never choose anything other than remaining right here, forever.

Lucky for you, that’s exactly what you get.

There’s never any release to it, no downhill trajectory, no moment to catch your breath.  Everything is pleasure, to the exclusion of anything else.

In the coming years, you’ll thank your friends for locking on to the Star Scout homing beacon and salvaging your sap-frozen bodies from the forest.  You’ll appreciate them traveling all the way to Del Thora, and meeting with the Squira druids there who were able to devise a technique to thaw out your amber prisons.  Because without their expertise, the sap would otherwise have proven to be indestructible.  But the moment after your release, you’re only capable of finally riding out the end of the orgasm that had been building up for days, and in the ensuing months of recovery all you’re able to wish for is to be trapped again, to be able to experience that pleasure all over again.

You’ll be in rehab for years learning to deal with the withdrawal symptoms, but eventually the two of you will recover.  But what you won’t ever get back is the chance to complete the mission, which thanks to your slip-up has resulted in a resounding failure.

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="218" name="FC03A" tags="" position="1625,875" size="100,100">In the end, who are you to stop her?  Your wife is a child of the trees, a guardian of nature.  If there is some kind of plant-based emergency happening, she’s the one who should be taking care of it.  And so you just stand back and watch as she slides out of her clothing, neatly folding it into a pile, then sets her staff down on top of it.  A sight that might have been surprising, but this is not the first time you’ve seen her want to be completely *au naturel* when communing with her environment.  Something about wanting nothing between herself and the world, being totally without artifice or the touch of civilization about her.

You maintain a respectable distance as she walks, cursing and muttering as your feet get stuck in knotted clumps of roots and your skin gets pricked by thorny brambles.  Revissa, in contrast, seems entirely unmolested by the difficult terrain, easily making it to the base of a massive tree deep into the tangle of plant life.  She has a dreamy smile on her face as she closes her eyes and meditates, standing still as stone atop a thick patch of moss.

At first, you think everything is working as intended.  You’ve seen her commune with nature plenty of times before.  But then you feel a prickle in the back of your mind, your instincts telling you something is not right with this situation.  And that’s when you see it.  From within the moss beneath Revissa’s feet, a thick sheet of plant matter begins to extend, creeping up her body and molding itself against her skin.  Druid or not, there’s no way Revissa would let that happen to herself if she were in her right mind.  Something sinister is happening here, and you need to stop it!

[[Call out to Revissa-&gt;FC03AA]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="219" name="FC03B" tags="" position="1625,600" size="100,100">“Hey… wait a second,” you say, running after her through the tangle.  

It’s a lot harder for you than it is for her - you get scratched by brambles and tripped up by roots, while Revissa seems unmolested by the rigors of the difficult terrain.  When you finally manage to catch up you’re fully out of breath, wheezing as you lay a hand on her shoulder.

“Come on… don’t just run off like this,” you say.  “It could be dangerous.”

Revissa turns and looks at you with a distant expression on her face, showing a detachment that makes your blood run cold.  

“The dangerous thing… would be to ignore it…” she murmurs, before pulling away and continuing her walk.

Okay, now you’re *sure* something’s wrong.  This time, when you catch up with her again, you grip her wrist firmly and tug, yanking her away from whatever it is she’s trying to get to.

(if: $faewin is true)[“Revissa!  Get a hold of yourself!” you yell.  “This is obviously a trap!  Maybe the fae woman is messing with us again!”

That seems to get through to her.  She blinks fiercely, trying to get a hold of her senses.

“Damned… fae…” she mutters.  But whatever has gripped her mind isn’t letting go.  Even as she realizes the peril she is in, her eyes turn towards the place she is being lured towards.  “I… I can’t… resist it…”

It’s clear now she’s being manipulated.  Something is controlling her mind.  And you’ve got to stop her before she throws herself into whatever trap is waiting for her.

[[Physically restrain her-&gt;FC03BB]]
[[Tell her to transform herself-&gt;FC03BC]]

A twitch of her staff summons some leafy vines to wrap around you and pull you to the forest floor, leaving you stuck as she walks with renewed vigor towards whatever fate the forest has in store for her.

By the time you manage to pull yourself free, she’s already nearly out of sight!

You yell out her name, trying to get her attention.  But your wife remains completely under the spell of the insidious plants, stuck in her own little world.  And the fleshy green plant matter continues to spread upwards, forming a tight sheath around her naked body.  Her legs are cinched together, arms forced to her sides as the material presses over her breasts, quickly advancing towards her face.

“Revissa!  Wake up!”

But she doesn’t hear you.  In a moment, she’s going to be entirely consumed!

[[Attack the plants-&gt;FC03AB]]
[[Keep trying to reach out to her-&gt;FC03AC]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="221" name="FC03AB" tags="" position="1925,875" size="100,100">You don’t know what, exactly, these plans have in store for her, but you know it can’t be good.  And so, despite what Revissa always says about protecting nature, you figure it’s time to do a little bit of… gardening.

Reaching for your sword at your back, you pull out the blade and start swinging, slicing at the roots and vines getting in your way, desperately trying to close the distance to her.  And yet despite the ferocity of your assault, Revissa remains entrapped by the strange plant matter threatening to envelop her.  Between sword strikes, you watch as her restrained body is consumed by the tight sheathe of living material, flowing past her shoulders and over her neck, threatening to consume her face.

You just aren’t fast enough.  By the time you make it to her side Revissa has been entirely encased by the plants.  A single vine has tightened around her waist to keep her arms pinned, then curled upwards to hold her neck in place, allowing the tip of it to press itself between her lips.  You can only imagine what it plans on doing with her in that state.

“Let her go!” you scream, winding up your sword to try and sever the tendrils keeping hold of her.

But before you make the swing, you feel something grab hold of your legs.  Looking down, you find more of that plant matter has caught hold of you - and is starting to creep up your body!

Frantically, you try to peel it off using the edge of your sword, but it advances faster than you’re able to remove it.  As it goes, some kind of liquid seeping out from the plant starts sizzling against your skin, not doing any damage other than to dissolve away your clothing.  And then to make matters worse, you feel vines begin to curl around your body, snagging your arms and pressing them to your sides.  Your sword is pulled away as the plant matter pushes upwards, anchoring your limbs in place and preventing you from making any headway in escaping.  And then, just like what happened to Revissa, a tendril winds around your neck to hold your head in place, allowing it to insert its tip right between your lips.

Despite your best efforts, you’ve been caught.  Revissa is completely encased alongside you, helpless in the way you’re only moments away from becoming.  You can feel the tip of the vine pulsate and throb, before it releases a sweet-smelling nectar down your throat.  And then… all your troubles start to melt away.

The tension fades from your limbs.  The anxiety flees from your mind.  Eyes and ears stop bothering to tell you about the world around you.  Because now, all that matters is the sweetness of the sap that flows through your body.  You don’t even notice as the plant matter finishes its advance, encasing you from head to toe.  And you no longer worry about the health and safety of your wife, contained in the sheath next to you.  You understand now why she volunteered for this.  Because all she wanted was to become part of it, merge with something grander and greater than herself.  You and she are now a part of the forest, connected to a vast, thriving network of infinite beauty.  Yes, you might have surrendered your freedom, your mobility, your sense of self, your very future, but in exchange you know you’ll never have to worry about anything again.

All you need to do is sit here and submit to it, offer your body as yet another organ for the vast ecosystem that surrounds you.

Gathering up your strength, you rush through the thick brambles and clustered roots, tripping and stumbling along the way but powering past them with brute force.  Vines try to snap around you, roots attempt to twist your ankles, but you ignore them, barreling in like a wrecking ball as you make it to your wife’s side.

“Revissa!”

You shout directly into her ear, but still she does not hear you.  And now you can feel that same plant matter taking hold of your legs, forming a thick second skin.  In a moment you’ll be trapped too!  But you can’t give up.  Revissa is a druid, a steward of nature - she’s not someone who should get helplessly overcome by some common plants!  You just need her to remind her of who she is.

But if words won’t reach her, maybe your emotions will.  By now, the plant matter has crept up to her neck, threatening to consume her face.  But before it does, you clasp your hands around her cheeks and pull head in closer, locking lips with her for a long, passionate kiss.  And as you pull away, her eyes finally shoot open in recognition.

“Melfy?  What was I do—” she begins, before a vine twists out from the cluster of plant matter and wraps around her lips.  Her cry of surprise is muffled entirely, before the green sheathe completely covers her head

Damnit!  You were so close!  But now all you can do is watch as Revissa is pulled away from you, and more and more vines begin springing up to wrap themselves around your own body.  You wanted to save her, but all you managed to do was get caught yourself.  Tighter and tighter they squeeze you, cutting off any chance to resist, arranging you in the same position as Revissa is as your own legs become consumed with the layer of plant-like growth.  

Is this the end for both of you?  You can’t even muster up the strength to struggle as you feel something twist itself around your mouth.  It’s so impossibly tight, you feel like you can hardly breathe.  All that’s left to do is close your eyes and accept your fate…

…
…
…

“Melfy!”

You’re brought back to reality by the desperate sound of your wife’s voice.  Opening your eyes, you see that she’s managed to somehow coax the plants away from her face, but they still have her tightly bound from the waist downwards.

“Fight it!” she yells.  “I’m not strong enough to do more than loosen its hold!”

You can see from her face that she’s concentrating with as much force as she can muster, using her connection to nature to manipulate the plants that are holding you.  She’s given you a chance, and nothing more - but that’s all that you need!

Many days later, Revissa will explain it to you better.  She’ll go over the exact ways in which your bodies were being used.  Most of it will go over your head.  But what you’ll remember is the way you felt, how relaxed you were, how connected with the world around you.

It takes nearly a week for the rest of your crew to track down your bodies.  They were following the homing beacon sent out by the Star Scout candy you swallowed at the start of the mission, but the readings were faint, since you barely had any ego left in you after the plant’s nectar dulled your mind.  But they did find you, and they did manage to cut you free.

Now the two of you are resting on a bed back on your ship, beginning the long, arduous process of rejoining the world of mammals after spending so much time as a plant.  Sadly, as a result, you’ve failed your mission, the data collection device destroyed during your time in captivity.  In a way, perhaps you’ll long for the time you didn’t have to think, because now you’ll never be able to stop dwelling on all the mistakes you made to end up here.

GAME OVER

[[Start Over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="225" name="FC03C" tags="" position="1925,725" size="100,100">It doesn’t come up as often as it should, but the fact remains that you’re a physical powerhouse.  Maybe not legendarily strong, but you can arm wrestle an orc and come away without any broken limbs, and that’s something most women can’t boast about.  

The key thing is leverage.  You’ve been tied up enough times to know that it doesn’t matter how strong you are if your points of articulation are cut off in the right ways.  Which is why it’s so important that Revissa managed to loosen just a few of the vines.  Because even though you’re still tied up, you now have mobility in the places that matter.  And you use that mobility to its fullest extent, reaching down and grabbing hold of the tendrils trying to wrap you up, yanking one away from your face as it tries to jam itself down your throat.

“Not today!” you yell with a snarl, taking hold of two opposite ends of the vines and snapping them apart with brute strength.  

After that, you reach down and snag the ends of the sheath of plant matter creeping up your body, pulling it down as if you were wiggling out of a particularly tight pair of pants.  You can feel it start to tear, not having been built to sustain so much force at this angle of movement.  Now almost entirely free, you prepare for one last tug to rip away the last of the vines, but get distracted at the last possible moment as the tip of one of the plants inserts itself in the slit between your legs.

“Guaaaaghhh~~” you shriek, starting as a howl of surprise but giving away to a mewl of pleasure.

One single distraction was all the plant needed to recapture you.  By now your clothing has been torn to bits, your naked body twitching with erotic stimulation as the vines has its way with you.  More tendrils snap around your arms, anchoring them behind your back, binding up your wrists and holding them firmly in place, as your entire body is tipped over and flops down to the ground.  Your legs get cinched together, locking the one probing vine in place inside of you, as another curls around your neck then inserts itself into your mouth.

And at this point, you’re helpless and defeated.  You can only squirm weakly as the sheath of plant matter reforms itself, creeping up your legs, over your butt and tail, consuming your chest, your neck, and finally your face.  The fluffy ears on the top of your head are the last to touch fresh air before you’re entirely sealed off, completely and utterly restrained.  Sweet nectar pours from the vine jammed between your lips, flowing down your throat and sending your mind into a dreamy, erotic haze, priming your body for an intense orgasm as the tendril between your legs continues its stimulating assault.

Well, you tried your best.  You gave it your all, but in the end, you were nothing more than a snack for a hungry plant.  All you can do is twitch and buck helplessly, writhing as you are brought to several overwhelming climaxes.  There’s nothing you can do but submit to your fate.  It seems like you’re destined for a life as plant food.

[[...or are you?-&gt;FC03CA]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="226" name="FC03BA" tags="" position="1775,600" size="100,100">You race towards your wife with all the speed you can muster, eventually bursting out through a tangle of thickets to emerge into a small clearing encircling a massive tree.  Its thick trunk is wider than you are tall, its branches forming a canopy over the area that nearly blots out the sun.  Revissa steps mindlessly in front of it, having cast off her clothing and set down her staff such that she is naked as she moves into position.

“Revissa!”

You call out desperately, but she’s too far gone.  The terrifying pull of these cursed plants have completely dominated her mind, commanding her to stand blankly at attention as some kind of thick green membrane begins pulling itself over her legs.  The material is made entirely out of plant matter, forming a skin-tight sheath that snugly hugs the contours of her figure.  Her legs are pressed together, her arms cinched against her side as it keeps climbing, threatening to completely encase her.  

There’s only a moment before she’s entirely consumed, so you’ll have to act fast!

[[Attack the plants-&gt;FC03AB]]
[[Keep trying to reach out to her-&gt;FC03AC]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="227" name="FC03BB" tags="" position="1925,475" size="100,100">If the allure of the plants is too much for her, then you’re not left with much choice.  You’re going to have to first make sure Revissa stays put before you actually get around to working on the problem.  And so, while she’s still cogent enough to realize you’re trying to help her, you grab her by the shoulders and push her down onto the ground.

“Okay… I’m gonna have to tie you down,” you say to her slowly.  “I need to be sure you’re not going to run off again before I go trying to take out whatever the source of this is.”

She is straining with all her might just to listen to your words, but she manages to force herself to nod in agreement.  And so, that settled on, you look around for anything to use to tie her up.  Thankfully, not too far away you spy some thick, green plant vines laying on the forest floor beside a giant flower with huge petals spreading out around it that are easily six feet long.  That should do quite nicely!

In retrospect, you really should have seen what was coming.  Though in your defense, you were a bit distracted trying to rescue your wife.  Either way, as soon as you give one of those vines a tug, your mistake becomes apparent.  Because the vines are attached to that giant plant, and that giant plant has been waiting for ages to chomp down on a snack as tasty as you are.

And so, when you tug on the vine, it tugs right back on you, and before you know it you’ve been yanked into the center of the plant’s petals.  As preoccupied as you were with Revissa, it did not even occur to you that the plant might have fought back, and so you are totally disoriented as the leaves wrap around you and a cloud of pollen swirls in the air, filling your nostrils with an intoxicatingly sweet aroma.

After that… everything is sort of a haze.  You’re aware of some kind of fleshy pink tendril wrapping around your body, helping you discard your clothing and weapons.  None of that seems particularly important anymore.  Useless, really.  After all, these leaves are the only covering you’ll ever need!

You’re also aware of Revissa getting up from the ground and walking into the plant-mouth together with you, her clothing left behind on the forest floor.  Already entranced by the siren song of the wood’s magic, the pollen isn’t even necessary to gain her compliance.  She steps in willingly, taking her place beside you as the pink elastic plant stalk begins to wrap itself around the two of you, holding your limbs tightly and pressing in against your lips.  Now even if you wanted to, you’d be unable to call for help… not that there’s anyone nearby to hear you anyway.

And so, the two of you stand there, helplessly compliant, as the plant begins to fold its massive leaves around its prey, happy to have finally found a meal that will be sure to keep it satisfied for a long, long time.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="228" name="FC03BC" tags="" position="1775,475" size="100,100">Realizing you only have a few moments before Revissa loses control of herself, you press your hands down firmly on her shoulders and look deeply into her eyes.

“Revissa… I need you to use your shapeshifting magic.  Transform into something small and portable, okay?  I’m gonna get you out of here, I promise!”

It’s clear she is using all of her willpower just to stop herself from moving.  Does she even have enough left in the tank to do any magic?

“I…” she says, clearly struggling.  “I… can’t…”

“Being small won’t impact your ability to get to where you need to go, right?” you say soothingly.  The trick to overcoming mental compulsion is to offer alternatives reasonable to the goals that are being forced on the victim.

She spends a moment considering that, but eventually nods.

“So why don’t you turn yourself into a cute little mouse, okay?  And then I’ll let you go.”

Another nod.  And then she closes her eyes, draws from the wellspring of natural energy around her to activate her shapeshifting magic.  Her body starts to shrink, green fur sprouts from her skin, whiskers growing from her cheeks as her nose becomes all cute and twitchy.  

Just like that, she’s become an adorable little mouse, and immediately starts to scamper towards a deeper section of the forest.  But you’re not a wolf for nothing.  Predator instincts kick in, and you dive towards your transformed wife, catching her not with your hands but your jaws, chomping down on her soft green fur.  Of course, you don’t actually bite down.  For one, you have no desire to hurt her, but for two if you did too much damage the spell keeping her in this form would be broken and she’d revert to her natural state.

So instead, you scoop her up into your arms, pulling the flailing mouse close to your chest.  And then you turn and run, trying to make it back to the river before her addled mind realizes she can change into something bigger and stronger to escape your grip.  Leaves and vines, thorns and brambles spring up around the ground to try and stop you, and branches of trees bend to block your path, but you barrel through all of them, intent only on protecting the woman you love.  

When you finally see the river you don’t stop running, instead diving straight in with a colossal splash.  As the sound of rushing water fills your ears you pull your mouse-wife in even closer, just trying to keep both your heads above water as the current sweeps you downstream.

Several minutes later, the two of you emerge, drenched and exhausted, and throw yourselves onto the shore.  Revissa is back in humanoid form, and also seems to have regained control of her mind.  Pulling out your holo-map, you find you’ve basically lost all the progress you’ve made up until this point, having been carried back nearly to the entrance of the forest.

Revissa leans over and kisses you, thanking you for the rescue.  And together you both decide mind-altering plants are not worth the trouble.  Instead of following the river, you’ll double back to the start and find a different route to your destination.  

[[Return to the start-&gt;FA06]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="229" name="FC03BD" tags="" position="1625,450" size="100,100">“Hold on,” you say, pressing down firmly on her shoulders.  “I’m gonna find whatever is controlling you and get rid of it!  Just stay here.”

Revissa looks at you with bleary eyes, but nods slowly.  It’s clear it is taking all her willpower to resist whatever has its hold on her.  After you help her sit down against a tree, you run off into the woods, searching for anything that looks out of place.  Though… as you wander, you realize you don’t actually know what you’re looking for.  After five minutes pass without you seeing anything noteworthy, panic starts to set in.  What were you doing, leaving Revissa alone?

So you turn and double back, looking for the tree where you left her.  But try as you might, you don’t see her!  Now fully frantic, you search the ground for tracks, finding evidence of her footsteps moving off in a direction opposite the one you had run down.  Quick as you can, you follow them, finally catching sight of her silhouette walking in a hypnotic daze towards a clearing.

[[Catch up with her-&gt;FC03BA]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="230" name="FC03BX" tags="" position="2075,475" size="100,100">The interior of the plant is warm and wet, filled with an indescribable sweetness.  You put up no resistance as the fleshy stalk wraps ever more tightly around you, pressing you and your wife together into a deeply intimate embrace.  Your lips encircle hers without any thought crossing your mind, and your legs spread open as the tips of the plant stalks insert themselves into your unprotesting nether regions.

Both of you coo in delight as you’re brought to the first of many overpowering climaxes, kissing each other deeply as your new floral home keeps you happy and stimulated.  You have no way of knowing what, exactly, the plant wants from you, but apparently you have something to offer it, because now that it has you, it folds up into itself to form a thick, bulb-like carapace that prevents anything outside from getting in.  And then, the bulb digs itself into the ground, retreating beneath the soil so that nothing can get at the two bodies entwined in its symbiotic hold.

Over the years, you and Revissa contribute to the plant’s growth, helping it to spread its roots far across the forest, allowing it to create a thriving network of interconnected organisms.  The two of you, trapped in your subterranean bulb, are the nexus of all the new development, your mental energies somehow harvested to keep everything neatly organized.  Of course, the two of you are never consciously aware of it.  For the endless years ahead of you, you both experience nothing but happiness, awash with the constant stimulation your bodies provide to one another.  You’ll never know fear, or pain, or hunger, or unhappiness again, nor will your bodies age or decay.  In a way, you’ve become eternal, an unchanging fixture of the forest that will always be there for you.

At this point, even if you could leave, you wouldn’t want to.  But, of course, the fact remains that you *can’t* leave.  And you never will.

And then, the bulb digs itself into the ground, retreating beneath the soil to stop anything from getting at the two bodies entwined in its symbiotic hold.

Luckily for you, hiding itself is the only major defense it has.  Because even though there’s no external indicator of where you’ve been buried, the Star Scout homing beacon candy you swallowed at the start of the mission still broadcasts your location to your allies.  It takes several days, but they do eventually find you, and manage to dig you up from the ground - destroying the plant that caught you and many others in the forest in the meantime.  When she wakes up, Revissa makes a token objection to the needless violence against nature, but even she has to admit it is preferable to spending the rest of her life as fertilizer.

Unfortunately, the data collection device you were entrusted with was destroyed in the confusion, meaning your mission was ultimately a failure.  But at least you’ve escaped with your body and mind intact.  Though maybe from now on, you’ll be a bit more hesitant the next time your wife asks you to help her with the gardening.
 
[[Start Over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="232" name="FC03CA" tags="" position="2075,725" size="100,100">You lose track of time as the plant has its way with you.  As far as you know, it could have been hours.  Time loses all meaning in the face of the pleasure you’re being subjected to.  But eventually the sensations subside, and suddenly you find yourself being ejected, spat out from the mouth of the plant like a cat coughing up a hairball. 

Now you’re splayed out on the forest floor, naked and exhausted, sitting in a pool of fragrant plant sap.  Revissa is standing above you and quickly takes your hand, pulling you to your feet.  She pops a berry between your lips, the kind she grows with her magic to restore stamina, and you feel a rush of strength return to your limbs.

“Come on, we need to get out of here,” she says, tugging on your arm.

You have just enough presence of mind to grab your pouch full of equipment before the two of you run back towards the river.  Everything is still a blur, your body aching from all the stimulation, your mind in a euphoric fog, but the tightness of Revissa’s grip on your hand is something to focus on as you make your retreat.  When you finally reach the river, the two of you collapse into each other’s arms, panting with both relief and fatigue.

When you catch your breath, Revissa explains that she was able to use her nature magic to command the plants to release you - but she only had the time to focus thanks to you causing all that damage before you were captured.  On the one hand, you’re glad your strength proved to be useful, though on the other, some small part of you wished you could have actually gotten to be the big hero for once.  You never actually get to look cool on your adventures, and it kind of bums you out.

But at least you’re both still alive and not trapped inside of a hungry plant.  Though you both lost your clothing and gear, you at least managed to grab your supply pouch, so the data collection device you need for the mission is safe.  And some of the matter resynthesizer capsules Jyumon provided you with allows you to provide replacements for everything else you lost.  After a few minutes, you’re both equipped and ready to go - though now there’s the question of which direction to head in.

Obviously, you could continue forward for your mission.  But at this point, it might be worth doubling back to check out that settlement you passed.  If the plants are this aggressive out here, it could be useful to find out how these other visitors managed to avoid getting caught by them.  Alternatively, you could just give up on this route entirely and try a different path to get through the forest.

Learning about plants is secondary.  And to be honest, at this point you’re anxious to get out of here anyway, lest you become a snack for another hungry flower.  And so you push forward, continuing along the path of the river towards the destination on your map.

Thankfully, you make it an hour without any further interruptions.  Revissa is careful not to do any more communing with nature, and you keep your eyes peeled for any signs of creeping vines or pollen-spitting bulbs.]

Eventually, you reach the point where you need to branch off from the river, and to your relief, the only thing in your way is a large, open, grassy patch of land, no trees, flowers, or bushes in sight - there’s not even any large rocks or other obstructions for a predator to hide behind.  In such a wide, clear area, you feel like there’s no chance of getting taken by surprise.

In retrospect, you should have foreseen the problem.  Together, you and Revissa begin marching across the open plain, eyes darting warily back and forth - towards the distant trees, towards the river behind you, towards the sky above - everywhere but down at your feet.  If you had looked that way, you might have noticed the ominous way the blades of grass shifted as you walked over them, swaying not in sync with the direction of the wind but their own internal chemistry.  How every strand bent towards the intruders in their territory, how the two of you were not welcome, even here, in an open, unassuming stretch of land.

The grass waits until the two of you are far into the center of the patch of green, when you stop for a moment to pull off your boot to shake out a pebble that had gotten stuck.  It is the very moment that the rock strikes the ground that the grass begins to sway, suddenly growing in length and spooling outwards with a mind all its own.  In an instant your legs have been wrenched together, throwing you off balance and making you drop your boot onto the ground.  More blades of grass twirl upwards to ensnare and destroy the foreign object, turning it into tiny scraps that are swiftly buried beneath the soil.  As if the grass wants to cover up any trace of your existence.

Beside you, Revissa shrieks in surprise as she, too, is targeted, her staff yanked from her hand and dropped with a soft thunk onto the soft green surface beneath her.  Your instinct is to reach out towards her, but the growing coils of flora capture your arm and pull it against your body, shredding any clothing it catches along the way.  Now realizing the peril the two of you are in, your wife tries to close her eyes and use her magic to connect with the grass trying to entrap you, but all she gets is a terrifying, violent impulse to subjugate all that does not belong.  She comes out of her trance with a gasp, just as the grass curls past her chin and over her mouth to seal away her voice.

And just like that, the two of you are caught.  The grass blades form impossibly tight, intensely sturdy bands of material, wrapping you up like you were a pair of mummies.  You can’t move a muscle, can’t make a noise, can’t possibly escape as it coils itself more and more firmly around your bodies.  And once it is sure you’re completely at its mercy, the grass yanks you downwards, slamming your wrapped forms against the soil.  Now you can only wriggle about like worms, but even that is taken away from you as additional tethers snake out to anchor you both in place, forcing you to look upwards towards the sky.

The two of you make helpless, plaintive mewling noises into the gags that have covered your lips, but they are barely audible against the gentle sound of grass swaying in the wind.  You’ve both been pulled down so low, restrained so snugly, that from a distance you wouldn’t even be visible against the endless sea of green, aside from maybe a tiny flash of yellow hair.  Side by side the two of you lay, utterly immobilized, capable of doing nothing but staring upwards at the bright warm rays of a sun that seems to taunt you with its freedom.

Paradoxically, despite the grass’s hatred of foreign intrusion, it seems that it has answered the problem by making sure the both of you stay here for a long, long time.  And, trapped as you are, there’s nothing you can do but lay here and wait to see what happens next.

For several minutes you walk, keeping your eyes peeled for any signs of danger, but it seems the plants are no longer calling out to your wife with their siren song of togetherness.  And so, after a long stretch of tension, you finally let yourself relax, slowing your pace to normal and sparing a glance towards your map readout to figure out the next route you’ll try to take.

Unfortunately, it is at the exact moment that you first let your guard down that you feel the rumble of movement from beneath the soil, followed by the eruption of several hidden creeper vines that dart upwards and wrap themselves around your limbs.

Escape is impossible, the prospect of rescue your only hope.  But as the days go by, it becomes clear that no one is coming to save you.

You’ll never know what happened to the rest of the crew.  Maybe something else on this planet snatched them up.  Or maybe they tried, and failed, to find the two of you, spent weeks searching before being forced to give up and leave in defeat.  It’s impossible to tell one way or the other.  Because the only information you have available to you is what you see in the sky above, and the clouds aren’t very talkative.

And so the days pass, you and Revissa wrapped up side by side, held taut by the hateful strength of innumerable blades of grass.  Because everything on this planet is made of ghost matter, there’s no need for the verdant tendrils to tend to your needs, to worry about giving you food or water.  Though you get plenty of the latter whenever it happens to rain.

You used to always wish you had more time to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the world moving on around you.  Well, lucky for you, you’ve finally gotten that wish.  And even better, you’ll continue to be able to live out that fantasy, now and forever.

Which is why you notice the familiar silhouette of your ship the Lucky Break coming in from the east.  It lands on the wide patch of grass and lowers a loading ramp for your allies to come out in search for you.  The grassy deathtrap tries its best to capture them all and consume the ship as well, but a fireball spell from Jyumon releases its hold on them and teaches the meadow there are worse things than unwanted feet trampling the grass.  

Unfortunately, even though they do manage to save you, the data collection device was destroyed in the scuffle.  And without it, the mission is impossible to complete.  So you are forced to leave the planet with your tail between your legs, free and healthy, but with a terrible fear of grass that will make you unable to ever mow a lawn again.

At this point, you’re half-considering heading back to your ship and seeing if you can’t rig up some kind of parachute system for a fly-over.  Because no matter how you slice it, you can’t see another viable path.

Eventually you groan in annoyance, flicking off the map display to see if Revissa has any other ideas.  But as you look around, you’re surprised to find that she’s nowhere in sight.

“Revissa?”

You call out for her, hoping she’s just wandered off again to inspect some interesting flowers.  But you don’t get any reply.

Now your heart starts pounding in your chest.  You were only distracted for a few minutes.  There’s no way she’s gone so far in that short amount of time that she wouldn’t even be able to hear you.

“Revissa!!”

This time you yell as loudly as you can, scaring some birds away from branches on a nearby tree.  Still nothing.

Where could she have gone?  Is she hurt?  Is she hiding?  Or worse, did one of the many terrible dangers you’ve encountered in these blasted woods snatch her up?

Now you start moving frantically, poking your head between trees, searching the ground for tracks, checking for any snapped twigs that might indicate a path someone took to leave the area.  But you can’t find anything.  So you increase your search radius, moving out of the small clearing you’d been waiting in, checking for any signs of life at all.  It’s only after a solid ten minutes that you finally notice something, not with your eyes, but your ears.

It’s a soft sound, barely audible, hardly more than a whisper, but you hear it.  It’s the sound of someone’s voice, grunting and moaning.  As fast as you’re able, you rush towards the noise, pushing past a tight cluster of tangled brambles to emerge in front of a large tree.  You’re sure the sound came from here.  And in fact, you can still hear it.  But where’s its source?  Looking around, you eventually notice something out of place on the ground near the tree’s base, so you move over to look.

What you find are torn bits of cloth.  *Familiar* cloth.  White and gold and green, and a little lacquered wooden moth emblem, the symbol of Un-Rama, the forest spirit Revissa worships.  It’s your wife’s clothing!  But if that’s here, then where is she?

At this point, two things happen in quick succession.  The first is that you look up, and finally discover the source of the noise.  Your wife is there, suspended between the upper branches of the trees, completely naked, save for the tight reams of spider silk expertly woven around her shapely figure.  It’s so snug it’s practically a second layer of skin, accenting her lovely curves in a way that would be deeply erotic if you had a chance to appreciate it.  The reason her voice was so muffled was the ball-shaped gag of webbing forced between her lips, sealing off anything other than a few plaintive grunts.  As you make eye contact with her, she looks down at you desperately, pupils darting furiously towards the second thing that happens.

It’s over so quickly, you barely even have time to process it.  All you see are four dark shapes creeping past your peripheral vision - a set of spindly black spider legs.  Each of them has a stringy length of silk dangling from the tip, and as they curl around you in unison each of them finds a part of your body to expertly restrain.  

You’re captured in moments.  You don’t even have time to reach for your sword before the weapon is pulled from your back.  A moment later, the blaster on your belt is gone too, along with your pants, boots, shirt, and cape.  Because in addition to the four silk-spinning legs wrapping you up, there are also four more legs armed with sharp pincers at the end of them, able to slice through your clothing like a hot knife through butter.  In less than a second you’re naked, and a second after that every limb has been completely plastered with silk, cutting off even the most basic of movements.  Then you’re spun around, so quickly you can’t even see what’s got you, other than a few flashes of red skin and black chiton.  Before your head stops spinning, you feel something force your lips open and glue a gob of sticky webbing into your mouth, gumming up your tongue and making anything other than a helpless mewling wail impossible to vocalize.  And once your voice is cut off, the gag is fixed in place around the back of your head, and you’re hoisted up into the air, suspended above your equally defeated wife.

In less than a minute, you’ve been transformed from capable explorer to utterly powerless damsel, as much a prisoner as Revissa.  You can’t move a muscle, can’t make a sound, can’t even twitch your tail.  You’re trapped, completely and utterly, and the culprit who so effortlessly defeated you is standing below you with a satisfied look on her face.

“I knew there was something wandering all over my forest,” she says, lazily tugging on a silk line to make the two of you vibrate.  “But if I’d known you were such cuties I’d have tracked you down much sooner.  Just what *were* you doing, poking around in so many places?”

You should have known better.  Spending so much time without making any progress, it was only a matter of time before something took notice.  That something is a gorgeous spider lady, and now the two of you are utterly helpless and completely at her mercy.  You strain fruitlessly against the impossibly tight webbing, finding not even an iota of leeway to squirm out of it.  There’s no escaping from this one.

Idly, the spider-woman digs through the equipment she liberated from your body.  She notices your comm device, and smashes it against a tree, making sure no one uses it to track you.  Then she finds the data collection device, and, not knowing what it is, sets it down on the ground then vaporizes it with your hand-held blaster.  So much for your mission.  But that’s the least of your worries right now.  

“Hmm…” she says lazily, looking up towards are bundled up prizes once she’s finished combing through your stuff.  “Now what to do with my new toys…”

You make a plaintive mewling sound into your gag, but it does nothing towards convincing her to let you go.  If anything, the absolute helplessness in your eyes only confirms the idea she has for your fate.

“I know!  You two love wandering around so much… so how would you like to tour the galaxy?  As product demonstrations.”

At the moment, it’s impossible to tell what she means by that.  But as your new life starts to unfold, you’re about to find out.

[[Go on tour-&gt;FA06C]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="239" name="FA06C" tags="" position="1400,700" size="100,100">Over time, you come to know who your owner is, and what plans she has for Spectra I.  Her name is Tula, and she’s a Spider Princess - a half-breed offshoot of the aggressively territorial Spider Queen race.  The queens are powerful arachnid hybrids, bearing the upper torso of a beautiful woman and the lower body of a massive spider, and they love nothing more than to conquer isolated colonies or undefended planets and turn them into slave territories.  Prisoners are kept in check with cocoons made of their natural silken fibers, wrapped up tight and either put on display or relegated to sex toys in their harem halls.  But various complicated feats of chemistry, biology, and engineering are required to keep their cocooned captives fresh and enticing, forming a whole industry around the maintenance of permanently silk-bound prisoners.

Tula is hoping to disrupt the whole market by introducing a new product.  She’s tending to a fruit orchard here on the planet, fruits which, when consumed, confer the properties of ‘ghost matter’ to the silk produced by spider-kind.  In other words, instead of all that intricate and messy science, spider queens can instead eat a piece of fruit once a day and their webbing will be strong and sturdy, and will keep those wrapped up in it stuck in indefinite stasis.  No need to feed or care for them, no need to even worry about the frailties of old age - so long as they’re wrapped, the slaves won’t need any maintenance at all.  To sell her product, she’ll have to attend some technology expos, and she’ll need some ‘floor models’ to show off the wondrous power of ‘ghost silk’, as she calls it.  You and Revissa are going to be those models.

And so, she bundles you up, nice and tight, and packs you away in some shipping crates, to only be brought out when you’re being used to hawk her merchandise.  During sales events, you and Revissa are strung up in the middle of a show floor, where prospective buyers are encouraged to skitter up and examine you both to their heart’s content.  Grope you, finger you, pleasure you, poke and prod you with scientific instruments, confirm the reality that so long as you’re cocooned, you won’t ever need any kind of medical attention.  Suffice it to say, her product is a hit, sending her all over the galaxy on increasingly lucrative tours.

Over time, her business grows and grows, such that after a year or so, she’s gained enough notoriety that she no longer needs to prove herself by utilizing product displays.  And so you and Revissa spend longer and longer increments helplessly stuffed inside a shipping crate, as consistently helpless as the moment you were first caught.  As the years go by, your days on showroom floors dwindle to barely nothing, making you wonder if you’re eventually just going to be confined to the back of some musty storage closet forever.  But your fortunes finally turn on one of the rare days where you’re out on display.

[[Discover a new routine-&gt;FA06D]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="240" name="FA06D" tags="" position="1275,700" size="100,100">Spider Queen sales events are, naturally, mainly populated either by Spider Queens, or by their representatives, usually their slave race of Marsyhan foot soldiers.  So it’s no surprise that you don’t encounter any familiar faces during your times on display.  But one day, towards the end of a shift, one happens to show up.

“Huh?  Melfy?  Is that you?”

You’re currently wrapped up against a tall metal pole, arranged vertically, with Revissa wrapped on the other end behind you.  You make a muffled ‘mmph’ of recognition as a woman from your past skitters into view.

She’s a Spider Queen named Azkumo, and you used to date her, many years ago.  Unlike most of her kind she was actually quite gentle and loving, but that wasn’t exactly what you wanted in an arachnid girlfriend, so you broke up with her.  Last you’d heard, she’d gotten into the film business, trying to make it as a holo actress.

Her eyes drift over your cocooned form, lingering on your bare breasts which are poking out from the silken wrapping.  She gives them an idle squeeze as she flags down the sales representative.  It’s been ages since Tula herself ran the booth at a convention; now she’s a big-time CEO, and she delegates responsibility to other Spider Princesses in her employ.  The rep quickly skitters over, and immediately gets a star-struck look in her eye as she recognizes your ex.  Apparently in the time since you’ve been captured, her film career has actually managed to take off.

“How much for the model?” she asks, nodding in your direction.

“O-oh… I’m terribly sorry ma’am… they’re not exactly for sale.  The products are the ghost-silk fruits…”

“Yes, but I want to buy her,” she insists, gently stroking your tail.  “How much?”

There’s a panicked grunt from behind you as Revissa voices her displeasure at the thought of being separated from you.  Azkumo seems to pick up on it.

“Fine, for both of them,” she continues, without missing a beat.  When the sales rep remains flabbergasted, she waves a credit chip in front of her.  “Let’s say 10,000 apiece.  Deal?”

She doesn’t wait for a reply, simply tapping her chip against the rep’s transaction pad and letting the payment go through.  And then she hoists you down off the pole and cradles you lovingly in her arms.

“What was it you said, all those years ago?” she says, with a devilish gleam in her eye.  “I wasn’t aggressive enough?  Too docile and loving?”

Her finger slips itself past the webbing and between your thighs.

“Well… I’ve learned a lot since then… and I’ll be happy to be every bit the domineering mistress you wanted from me.”

Without another word to the rep, she slides you onto her back, then does the same for Revissa.  You and your wife can only exchange panicked glances, unsure if this development is good or bad for your prospects of freedom.  For her part, Azkumo doesn’t give you another word as she skitters back to the starship hangar and loads you both onto her personal space yacht.  Being a holo-star has its perks, after all.

Especially ones like Azkumo, who clearly has some elvaan blood somewhere in her heritage, as evidenced by her dark gray skin tone (pureblooded Queens are a bright red).  And so she remains a big-name holo star for a full century and a half before she finally retires, settling down in a palatial mansion on a small moon she owns herself.

You and Revissa remain cocooned the entire time, never given even an ounce of freedom.  But at least you’re treated better than you were before.  You live out your days wrapped up in one of Azkumo’s bedrooms, your sexual needs tended to by her serving staff, who make sure to stimulate you both to completion at least five times a day.  As for your mistress, she spends less than half her time at her home, though when she does she always makes sure to give you some attention.  You’re not alone in that regard.  It turns out she’s collected every single one of her exes (and their romantic partners, if they’d found one since breaking up with her), and each one gets a dedicated bedroom to spend their days in.  Becoming a star also toughened her up, opened up the possessiveness her species is known for, though at least she is still loving and affectionate to her slaves rather than cruel.

And that is what you are - a slave.  It’s a step up from being a floor model for a line of silk products, but it doesn&#39;t give you any more freedom or agency in your life.  As advertised, Tula’s ghost silk keeps you young, fresh, and healthy for as long as you remain wrapped in it, without even a single fiber ever getting severed or loosened.  Which means, as the years stretch on endlessly, you’ll never have to worry about anything other than when the next time your owner will come in to give you some loving.

And if she’d had her way, that’s what you’d have remained for the rest of your lives.  But thankfully, you finally get a reprieve after years of captivity.  The Star Scout candy you swallowed so long ago proves to still be functional, sending out a distress call to the surrounding areas of space.  A passing scout one day happens to pick up on it and land on the planet, and successfully manages to negotiate with Azkumo for your freedom.  Though only on the condition you and Revissa volunteer as ‘background cocoons’ in independent holo-films for at least two weeks out of every year.  

Finally free, you find yourselves in an entirely unfamiliar galaxy that’s changed immeasurably since you were first captured.  That’s a whole new story in and of itself, but, needless to say, you’ve both failed your original mission.

GAME OVER

Technically, it could be considered trespassing to just stroll onto another person’s vessel like this, but aren’t you all kind of trespassing on this planet already?  Besides, the loading ramp is down, so it doesn’t look like they’re in high security mode or anything.

As you approach the ship, you can’t help but be appreciative of its design.  Unlike your Lucky Break, which has just an inelegant, boxy appearance, the Knottie craft is sleek and stylish, even for a cargo ship.  Knottie vessels are known for their signature squid-like shape, with the main ‘head’ at the front where the cargo and crew sit, and the long, mobile ‘tendrils’ at the back.  Though Knottie vessels are not the fastest or the strongest in the galaxy, they are absolutely the most maneuverable, thanks in no small part to the thruster arrays positioned all along the ‘tendrils’, each like the sucker on an octopus&#39;s arm.  It makes sense that this would be their priority, since the signature weapon on Knottie starships are their ‘energy nets’.  Basically, they fight by releasing long lines of electro-plasmic discharge in tight rings around enemy ships, literally tying them up with highly reactive material that fries propulsion, weapons, and guidance systems.  Once a ship is disabled, they love to board the enemy vessel and tie up its crew the same way they did the ship.

Well, let’s just hope that if you do get tied up here that it’s with some nice, soft ropes and not electro-plasma.

Once you finish musing on the marvels of Knottie engineering, you begin to walk up the loading ramp.  But as you do, you see several hovering security drones lying in wait just off to the side.  They are small, flat devices, about the size of a fist, but you know that doesn’t mean they can’t swiftly incapacitate you if they set their programming to it.  Which means that they likely aren’t going to be welcoming to visitors.]

The pre-fab buildings were clearly built for efficiency rather than aesthetics, made out of interchangeable parts that look as if they snap together like children’s building blocks.  Unlike the spaceship, which clearly has a Knottie design, the buildings have no distinctive style markings to them and could just have easily housed orcs, kemomi, or elvaans (okay, maybe not elvaans.  Most wouldn’t be caught dead living somewhere so drab).  Peering through a window, you find a barracks-like bedroom that could probably house four women at a time, though currently there’s no one visible living inside of it.

It honestly does look like the whole place is deserted.  If you wanted, you could spend the time to search each building individually - it doesn’t look like the doors are locked at all.

You have to stifle a gasp when you notice it.  Though the hardened chunks of sap are mostly opaque, when you get close enough you can see past the surface to what lies inside.  Each piece of resin holds a woman trapped inside of it, all of them bearing the distinctive head tendrils of the Knottie species.  The women are nude, and have expressions on their faces ranging from surprised, to relaxed, to aroused.  None of them are moving, which isn’t surprising, though at least they don’t appear to be in any immediate danger. (if: $rosamber is true)[However, among them is Ros’eela, you can’t help but notice.

(if: $ros is true)[
“These… are my co-workers,” Ros’eela says, walking up in front of the amber hunk and looking inside.  “This one is Nabri.  And that’s In’Deliab.  Crap, we were training together just the other day!”

You put a hand on her shoulder.  “I’m sure there’s some way to get them out of there,” you say quietly, glancing towards your wife for her input.

“They’re alive,” Revissa confirms, laying her hand on the smooth surface of one of the amber stones.  “This is made of the same Ghost Matter as the rest of the stuff on this planet, so they’ll be safe and healthy for as long as they’re in there.”

That’s a relief.  Though it doesn’t answer the question of how they got trapped in the first place.  Was it some kind of industrial accident?  Or… is there something more sinister at play here…

“Can they be freed?” you ask, casting a suspicious eye around the area for any signs of danger.

Revissa shakes her head.  “It’s… really strong stuff, I am pretty sure.  Conventional weapons would be useless against it.  But maybe the Squira priestesses of Del Thora would be able to do something.  They make use of a Sacred Sap in their rituals that has similar properties.”

On the one hand, they’re not stuck forever.  On the other, it means that there’s probably no tools you have in your arsenal here that can rescue anyone caught in the stuff.  So you definitely need to be diligent about finding what did this.

“Any clues about how this happened to them?” you ask.  “If there were any storage jugs around or something I would maybe guess there was some kind of industrial accident, but there’s nothing here… other than this giant flower…”

Too late do you realize the source of the threat, before it already starts to reveal itself.  You hear the rustle of leaves, smell the sweet scent of potent pollen, and see the massive leaves unfurl to reveal the culprit of the Knotties’ entrapment.

Maybe by looking it over, you’ll get a better idea about how the Knotties are running their operation.  You and Revissa move through the camp towards the work site, trying to remain silent, even though there doesn’t seem to be any activity or movement. 

As you get closer, the nature of the equipment becomes more apparent.  There’s some kind of saw apparatus that looks to be purposed for cutting down trees and shaping them into uniformly sized logs.  Another device is processing and purifying the tree sap you had seen earlier, pushing it through large vats that filter out any excess material from the liquid.  Yet another machine makes your skin crawl, since it features a conveyor that seems purposed for sending animal carcasses into a chamber that cleans and tans the material into usable leather.

With each machine you examine, Revissa grows more and more upset, until she comes to the last one in the line and points at it accusingly.  

“I don’t even know what this one does, but whatever it is, I’m sure it’s disrespectful!” she yells.  “Think of all those poor animals!”

You do your best to keep your mouth shut.  After all, as a kemomi, meat is an important part of your diet, and you never think too hard about where the stuff you buy comes from.  Sure, most of it is probably lab-grown, but you’ve been known to splurge every once in a while after a nice payday on a big, juicy, naturally-made steak.

Either way, it looks like Revissa is about to start getting violent with this equipment.  If you don’t lead her away now, she’s probably going to cause some property damage.

She’s pulled out the big guns this time, changing herself into a mighty T-Rex!  

As a terrible thunder lizard, she is almost twelve feet tall, all sense of humanoid attractiveness abandoned in exchange for the capacity to wreak massive property damage.

Only once everything is reduced to scrap and slag does she finally return to her adorable normal self, coming out of the transformation both exhausted yet exhilarated.

“Take that!” she yells, kicking a piece of sparking machinery off into the forest.  On its way, however, it clunks loudly against one final device that hitherto had escaped her wrath.

“Looks like you missed one,” you say, looking the equipment over.  

Unlike the other things, the purpose of this last gizmo is not immediately evident.  All it looks like is a small circular platform, maybe three feet wide, with two long metal poles sticking up from the sides.

She smirks as she sizes it up.

“Seems pretty flimsy,” she concludes.  “What do you say?  Wanna put those muscles to use and help me smash it with our own two hands?”

How could you say no to a smile like that?  And so you join her in walking up onto the platform.  You’re about to take hold of one of the metal poles to try prying it off when a loud robotic voice suddenly echoes from the machine’s base.

“PRESSURE PLATE ACTIVATED,” it drones.  “ANALYZING MATERIAL.  DESIGNATION - HUMANOID.  TWO SUBJECTS.  BEGINNING PACKAGING PROCESS.”

Wait… packaging?  Does that mean this device is used to bundle up the harvested materials and place them into containers for shipping.  Oh crap, that means–

“ACTIVATING PARALYSIS CHARGE,” the machine announces, before the base you are both standing on begins to vibrate with electricity.  

You both only have just enough time to realize the grave error you have made before it becomes entirely too late to avert it.  A powerful surge of energy rushes through both of your bodies, completely cutting off any motor functions.  The result is the two of you trapped in place, quivering from electric shock, unable to move, speak, or escape what is about to come.

“BEGINNING PACKAGING PROCESS.  REMOVING EXCESS OBSTRUCTIONS.”

A laser shines from the tip of the two poles, moving in an arc over your helpless figures.  And wherever it touches, clothing vaporizes, destroying all your weapons and gear.  You’re both left naked and exposed on the platform as it enters the next phase of your folly.

“ADJUSTING POSITIONING FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE.”

The platform vibrates again, delivering a surge of energy that jump-starts your muscles, forcing the two of you to take jerky steps closer to one another.  You press against each other tightly, arms shakily shifting so that you are intimately holding hands.

“LOADING ORGANIC CONTAINMENT TAPE.  BEGIN SPOOLING.”

There is a whir from beneath you as the platform starts to rotate, at the same time that several rolls of black duct tape are loaded onto the long poles.  The adhesive ends are stuck onto your skin, causing the tape to wind around you over and over, moving up and down to bind you up like a couple of love-struck mummies.

You can’t even make a sound of protest as the machine does its work, a single coil looping around your heads to force your lips together.  Tighter and tighter it presses, squishing your breasts into each other, covering up your face, your tail, your legs, your feet, concealing every inch of your naked skin as it finishes up the first layer and gets started on the second. 

At this point you’re entirely cut off from the outside world, shrouded in complete darkness, unable to even effectively hear since your floppy ears have been pressed down against the top of your head.  Mostly you just feel the vibrations as a third, then a fourth layer of tape is wound up around you, followed after that by some kind of spray that seems to be forming a lacquer-like seal over your impromptu prison.  Knotties are known for being fastidious when it comes to bondage, always going the extra mile to ensure the utter impossibility of escape of those subjected to their cultural forte, and it would seem their technology shares that attention to detail.  When the machine stops spinning the two of you are so firmly bound up that the very idea of getting out of it is laughable.  Instead, you just get released from the device’s grip and tip over helplessly, dropping into a waiting storage crate that is perfectly sized to fit your expertly packaged bodies.

And besides, you still don’t know what happened to the workers here.

For a moment, you think that things are settled now.  But then Revissa just can’t help herself but to aim a snarky quick Ros’eela’s way.

“Maybe to your people, the only spirituality is found in bondage,” she grumbles.  “But for me, I find meaning in nature itself.”

That, unfortunately, gets the two of them going into a heated debate about the virtues of each of their cultures, an argument that, after the first ten minutes, you realize isn’t going to end anytime soon.  And so, with a sigh, you flop down against the side of one of the machines and keep yourself out of it, taking a moment to appreciate the sights and sounds of the forest around you.  After all, you owe it to Revissa to take in that thing which she wants to protect.

It is, admittedly, very beautiful.  The color of the trees, the sound of scurrying animals, the feel of the grass against your feet, and the sweet, cloying smell of pollen wafting through the air.

Actually… that last one really is quite engrossing.  A thick, invigorating scent, one that seems to linger in your nostrils when you breathe it in, that flows through your body and fills you with a strange sense of warmth.  No… more than warmth.  It’s more like… a desire.  An imperative.  Yes, that’s what it is.    It grips you with a surprising amount of power, forces you into a dreamy daze of contentment and arousal.

And it seems the others felt it too.  Revissa and Ros’eela have stopped arguing and started kissing, falling on top of each other and rolling in the grass as they furiously make out.  Full of desire, you can’t help but throw yourself into the fray as well, knocking Ros’eela aside to monopolize Revissa for yourself.  The pink Knottie seems upset at first, but eventually allows herself to relax and wander off in a daze, heading towards the source of that alluring smell.

You and Revissa spend a good five minutes necking before you, too, find yourselves drawn in the same direction, walking in a dreamy stupor towards the intoxicating aroma.

[[Find the source-&gt;FC02G]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="250" name="FC02DE" tags="" position="2975,700" size="100,100">You know better than to get between your wife and a self-righteous rampage.  And so you stand aside as she waves her staff around and channels her nature magic into a transformation with incredible destructive force!  Before your eyes, you see her body shift, growing to a massive size as powerful scales ripple along her skin and a fearsome roar echoes from her throat.  She’s pulled out the big guns this time, changing herself into a mighty T-Rex!  

As a terrible thunder lizard, she is almost twelve feet tall, all sense of humanoid attractiveness abandoned in exchange for the capacity to wreak massive property damage.  Unlike some of her other transformations, this one comes with some significant drawbacks.  Namely, that she does not retain her intelligence when she is a dino, nor is it easy for her to keep hold on the structure of the spell.  Despite her size, a single strong hit can break her concentration and cause her to turn back into a lovely deer - and unluckily for her, Ros’eela seems none to keen about standing by while she wrecks her people’s equipment.

“Woah… hey, calm down there!” she yells, making what you would have thought to have been a rather foolish gambit, running right in front of the rampaging dino as she starts chomping at one of the machines.  

But it seems you underestimated the resourceful Knottie, because she manages to divert Revissa’s destructive tantrum with the use of a sturdy piece of wire, using her acrobatic skills honed as a slave dancer to leap and tumble around her legs without getting smushed.  As she goes she wraps the wire around Revissa’s monstrous limbs, pulling taut in such a way to send her tumbling to the ground.  When she impacts she loses her concentration on her spell, re-forming into her normal lovely self, albeit now she’s on her back and bundled up in an awkward hog-tie.

Honestly… you’re more impressed than upset.  You’ve never seen anyone incapacitate Revissa so quickly once she’d gone into dino mode.  But you’re not about to let the pink lady get the last word in over your wife, so you helpfully draw your sword and sever the ropes keeping her bound.

“Why’d you stop me!” Revissa snarls.  You halfway think she’s going to cast the same spell again to resume her rampage.

“Are you forgetting that I work here!” Ros’eela yells back.  “If I just stood by and watched I’d get chewed out by my boss… err… not that she seems to be around here right now.”

Sure enough, the camp remains totally empty.  

“It… really is weird,” the Knottie continues.  “She was always standing around here, overseeing the machinery and updating inventory logs on her data pad.  But now she’s… woah hey, wait.”

She notices something in the grass and picks it up.  

“This… *is* her data pad,” she muses.  “That lady was practically glued to this thing.  Something crazy must have happened if she just dropped it like that.”

And so the mystery deepens.  But it doesn’t seem like you’ll find any more clues in this area, so it’s best to keep looking elsewhere.  Revissa seems to have calmed down a bit now… though as you double back you see her turn around and eye that equipment with a ferocious gleam in her eye…

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="251" name="FC02DB" tags="" position="2850,700" size="100,100">You and Revissa are so tightly bundled up that any form of movement is flatly impossible.  The most you can do is vibrate helplessly as your mummified forms are fitted into the storage crate, squirming pointlessly as some metal clamps shut down around your figure to prevent any future shifting of position.  This leaves you with nothing to do but wonder how the hell you could possibly get out of this.

Though, now that you think about it, doesn’t the tape smell a bit like the tree resin you found on your way over here?  Is the adhesive locally sourced?  That would mean the tape has the properties of the planet’s unique Ghost Matter - namely, that you could be kept wrapped up indefinitely without the need of food, water, or other health services.  You wouldn’t even age a day!

“HEALTH SCAN COMPLETE.  SUBJECTS ONE AND TWO, GHOST MATTER PROTOCOLS CONFIRMED.  NO FURTHER INTERACTION NECESSARY.   INFORMING COMMAND OF PACKAGING STATUS…

Well, that confirms what you had just figured out all on your own.  And at least someone is being informed of what’s happened here.  Hopefully the Knotties won’t be too upset with Revissa destroying all their equipment… 

“....ORDERS RECEIVED.  COMMAND DECISION: INITIATE MAXIMUM PUNISHMENT PROTOCOLS.   LOCKING CONTAINMENT UNIT.  LOCK UNLEASH METHODS: NONE.  CONTAINMENT DURATION: PERMANENT.  NEXT OBJECTIVE: RELOCATE CONTAINMENT UNIT TO PLACE IT WILL NEVER BE FOUND.

Wait… what?  A little bit of property damage and they’re going to lock you away… forever?  And hide you someplace no one will ever find you?  You’d love to voice your opinion on that matter to the packaging machine, but you’re not capable of making any sounds at all.  So all the two of you can do is wriggle and moan uselessly as some hovering drones appear in the air and float down, inserting a data transfer wire into your storage container to inform it what needs to be done next.  The lid snaps shut, and you hear a series of powerful locks snap into place.  The two of you are thus plunged into absolute darkness, with no way to communicate other than plaintive grunts and groans.  Then you feel the box rumble and shake, presumably being lifted off the ground by those same droids, as it gets carried through the air to places unknown.

There’s no way to tell, since you’re unable to see outside your storage container, nor can you really hear anything beyond your own voices.  All you have to go on is the various vibrations and shifts in positioning the box goes through as it is loaded up onto some kind of transport and taken far, far away.

It’s only when you feel yourself being dropped, then a sense of bobbing up and down for a moment before you feel downwards descent that you figure it out.  All of that would be consistent with… water?  Your heart sinks just like your body as you realize the drones have decided to secure your captivity by dropping your prison into the deep ocean.  You feel yourself sinking for what feels like an hour before the box finally comes to a halt, resting at a slightly skewed angle from what must be the uneven ground at the very bottom of the sea.

This is absurd.  Why would the drones be programmed to dispose of you in this way?  You at least deserve a trial, or a chance to make your case in front of someone!  But you get no more input, no response to your helpless moans of protest.  There’s nothing the two of you can do but settle into your new, unending life of captivity.  You’re not sure if you should be thankful or upset that the cargo container you’ve been sealed in is so incredibly sturdy.  It seems totally resilient to the intense pressures of the deep ocean, not springing any leaks or bending or buckling in the slightest.  Under normal circumstances, if it ruptured while you were this deep you’d either drown or be crushed by the water pressure - probably both.  But considering the properties of ghost matter, maybe your life would be preserved until you naturally floated back up to the surface.

But that is a moot point, since the case remains firm.  With bindings made of ghost matter, you’ll never need food or water, never age a day.  Meaning that the two of you can persist here in utter helplessness for the rest of your long, long lives.  

No one ever comes to save you - how could they?  How could they possibly locate you when you’ve been dumped to the bottom of the ocean.  So all that’s left is to live out the ages in total darkness, with nothing but the occasional thump of a passing fish against your container as entertainment.

Thankfully, you swallowed that Star Scout homing beacon at the start of your adventure.  Without it, your allies would never have been able to find you.  As it stands, it still takes them three weeks of searching, moving in wider and wider arcs around the planet, before they finally get a strong enough signal to lock onto your location.  And then it takes another month of negotiations and requisitions to acquire the proper equipment to dig you up from the bottom of the sea.  Of course, the whole time you’re trapped, you have no idea there’s any rescue coming, so after the first few days you had settled into the prospect of this being the end for you.

Lucky for you it isn’t - though sadly your mission has ended in a resounding failure.  The data collection device is destroyed, and Vhaja had to pull every string she had to get someone to come to restricted space to save you - greatly damaging her career in the process.  Needless to say, she won’t be asking you to go on any more missions any time soon.

“We’re sorry… for the intrusion…” Revissa adds weakly, her eyes as blank and submissive as yours.  “We were… investigating why… there were people harvesting the resources in this forest…”

The two of you have completely fallen under the spell of this beautiful plant woman.  She has rich green skin, short, fluffy hair the texture of leaves, and curvaceous body that extends down to the thighs before it vanishes into the center of the petals of the giant flower.  The interior of her flower is filled with more of that amber liquid, sloshing around whenever she moves, creating the powerful, honey-sweet scent that so effectively rendered you and your wife into compliant slaves.

“Hrmm…” the plant woman says with a frown.  “It’s true… they didn’t belong here.  But it’s okay!  Now they do!  They’re part of the forest now, and they’ll stay that way forever!”

You and Revissa nod blankly, as if to agree that were a fitting punishment for their crimes.  Though with every syllable that falls from her lips, you both find yourselves falling deeper and deeper into your erotic haze.  It’s impossible to think of anything other than acting on those impulses.  Thankfully, the plant woman seems to be able to read the looks of desire on your faces, and is kind enough to start nudging you in the direction you need to go in

“My name is Petal,” the woman says after a moment, reaching down to brush a hand over each of your cheeks.  “What are your names?”

Slowly, you open your lips to tell her, but strangely, you find that you can’t remember it.  You can’t remember anything at all.  Why you’re here, where you came from - none of it.  And so you just stare blankly, an apologetic look on your face, sorry for letting her down.  But then she smiles, and its as if everything in the world is right again.

“Oh… that’s okay.  Names aren’t that important anyway.  Besides, I can see how much you two are in love with each other.  And it would be a real shame to keep you apart.  So, why don’t you get yourselves out of those clothes, and we can find a place for you here as well?”

You and Revissa nod blankly, as if to agree that were a fitting punishment for their crimes.  With every syllable that falls from her lips, you both fall deeper and deeper under her control, any thoughts of resistance or escape quickly banished from your minds.

“My name is Petal,” the woman says after a moment, reaching down to brush a hand over each of your cheeks.  “What are your names?”

Slowly, you open your lips to tell her, but strangely, you can’t remember.  You can’t remember anything at all.  Why you’re here, where you came from - none of it.  And so you just stare blankly, an apologetic look on your face, sorry for letting her down.  But then she smiles, and its as if everything in the world is right again.

“Oh… that’s okay.  Names aren’t that important anyway.  Now why don’t we get you two out of those clothes, and then we can find a place for you to fit into this forest as well?”

It fills you with an indescribable joy, to know that Petal would want to allow you to remain here in the forest with her.  Even after you’ve been so rude, forgetting your name like that.  And so you readily comply, lamely fumbling with boots and belts and shirts and pants, dropping weapons and equipment that you no longer even know the purpose of.  When you’ve finally got everything off, Petal gives you a nod of appreciation that makes your heart swell with pride, and then makes a motion for you to hold still.  Of course, you comply.

You and Revissa stand there as long, leafy tendrils extend from the bottom of her flower, wrapping around you and tightly restraining your limbs.  They feel taut and secure, too strong for you to break out of - though that’s a moot point, since you’d never want to run away from your new favorite person in the world.  Looking between the two of you, she decides to start with your wife, hoisting her up into the air and then dunking her upside down into the center of the pool of sap inside her flower, making sure to cover every inch of her body.  When she’s pulled out, her face is in a placid state of relaxment, all ounce of tension or worry banished from her frame.  She draws Revissa in for a long, lusty kiss, then suspends her in the air, allowing more and more of her nectar to drip down her vines to continue coating her.

“And now it’s your turn,” she says brightly, the very sound of her voice filling you with an indescribable warmth.  

The vines holding you yank you upwards, getting no resistance from you as you’re brought in close.

“And down you go!”

As you’re dunked into her nectar, you feel the sweet amber liquid fill your throat, feel it drip down to your stomach then flow through the rest of your body to circulate the warmth and calmness it brings.  It makes you feel nothing but joy.  You sigh in delight as your worries, your fears, your life before this moment all melt away, leaving you as nothing but a vessel for pleasure and contentment as she draws you in for your kiss.]

Her lips are soft yet firm, warm and inviting, infinitely calming.  You surrender every aspect of your being to that kiss, give her all of what you are and ever will be.  She seems to enjoy that.  As she draws back from the kiss, she tenderly caresses your cheek, then casts her eyes around the clearing.

“Now then… where to put this one…”

There’s a flat tree stump a short distance from her flower, probably cut down by harvesting tools employed by the Knottie interlopers.  Keeping your wrists restrained above your head, she flips you right side up and sets you down on the stump, letting the heavenly nectar flow over your unresisting body.

Across from you, you hear a thump, and are just barely cognizant enough to turn your attention towards the sound.  You see that Revissa has finished ‘marinating’, the sap having hardened into a thick hunk of amber around her unprotesting body.  She looks so utterly at peace in her new home, eyes closed, the slightest of smiles apparent on her pursed lips.

Like the Knotties around her, she’s now become a part of the forest, the amber encasing her somehow harnessing her life energy to facilitate growth and nourishment in the trees around her.  You’re not quite sure how you even know that, but it seems obvious to you that this is the case.  And now that you know it, you are deeply eager to join her in service to the forest.

A torrent of sap flows over your body, at first forming a glistening, lacquer-like coating over your skin, but eventually congealing as more and more is provided.  Soon it has fully hardened, forming an oblong, opaque shell for you to stand in, a perfectly snug cocoon of resin that hugs every inch of your body from finger to toe.  You’ve never felt more at peace, more attuned to the world around you, your bright eyes and eager smile a reminder of the happiness that now remains frozen on your inanimate face.]

“There we go!  I think it’s perfect!” Petal says cheerily, pulling her tendrils away from the new adornment to her happy little grotto.  “Everyone is right where they need to be!  And that’s where they’ll stay.”

And so, after a quiet moment of appreciation surveying the new additions to her collection, she stretches her arms, yawns lazily, then recedes into her flower, folding the petals over her torso and disappearing from view.

The days pass by in a blur, soon becoming years, decades, and centuries, the forest treating you and the others like nothing more than inert rocks.  You don’t mind one bit.  You’ll never know what happened to the rest of your crew - maybe they got caught by something else on the planet, or maybe they searched for you but could never find you.  It hardly seems to matter.  After all, you’ve got everything you want right here.  

No pain, no worries, no stress, no conflict, just warm sunlight and fresh pollen.  The lovely Petal who put you here is long gone, spreading her roots to other parts of the forest that need nutrients like you to keep it flourishing.  She leaves you and the others behind, so that you can keep protecting your new home, maintain order and balance and harmony, from now until the end of your days.

And with the ship taken off and the site abandoned, you’ll have plenty of time to enjoy it.

It is only many months later when you finally awaken from your torpor.  As it turns out, the rest of your crew were able to track you down thanks to your Star Scout homing beacon, extracted your amber shells and kept you in storage on your starship until a solution could be found.  That answer, like Revissa expected, resided on Del Thora, where the Squira priestesses were able to use techniques they had mastered with their native sacred sap to thaw you both out.

After you recover, you’ll be thankful for the rescue.  But for now all you have to look forward to are weeks of convalescence, both physical and mental, as you slowly regain the ability to treat yourself as a discrete entity and not just another part of the forest.  Someday, you’ll travel the galaxy again, but even if you do, you’ll never get another chance to complete this particular mission.

Maybe next time, you’ll be more careful about smelling the roses.

“Hey, don’t you have some magic that works like active camouflage?”

She nods.  “Yes, it was very helpful during my days in the resistance.”

Well, she’s not exactly fighting for the freedom of her homeworld right now, but she’s still trying to save a forest.  So it’s kind of the same thing.  With a wave of her staff, she shrouds the two of you in a magical aura that causes you both to take on the chameleon-like property of blending in with anything you press your body up against.  Yeah, this should work!

Together, you creep up the loading ramp and then press against the back wall of the cargo bay, letting the magic change your skin to the same metallic color of the wall behind you.  So far, so good.  And then you begin to shimmy along the edge of the bay, trying not to upset the small squadron of drones keeping watch.

Unfortunately…

“HEAT SOURCE DETECTED” one of the tiny drones announces in a loud robotic voice.  And then a half-dozen of them break off and zoom right towards you!

Well, crap.  It figures they would have ways of detecting enemies rather than just visual scanners.  You and Revissa both reach for your weapons, but before you get that chance, the drones are upon you.  A bright red light emits from their center, sending a laser pulse up and down your bodies.

“DISINTEGRATION BEAMS ACTIVATED!” they helpfully announce, just as every scrap of clothing is instantly eradicated from your bodies.  That includes your sword and Revissa’s staff, making both of you sitting ducks as they continue to operate according to their programming.

“CAPTURE PROTOCOLS INITIATED” they say next, whizzing around you as they begin to dispense some sort of sticky spools of tape from their bodies.  The material proves to be quite adhesive and frustratingly sturdy, wrapping around your arms, legs, and lips in no time flat.

As expected, the security drones whizz out and begin to circle around you, flashing red lights on their surface indicating they have detected a potential threat.  But thankfully, they do not immediately attack.

“STATE PURPOSE OF VISIT” one announces with a prerecorded message, the robotic voice much louder than one might suspect from such a small device.

You glance at Revissa, and then shrug.  “We’re like to discuss your operations here in this forest, and, uh, politely suggest you reconsider your tactics so that you can, uh, be working in better harmony with the local ecosystem?”

There is a long pause.  

“PURPOSE IRRELEVANT”, the drone eventually announces.  “DEPART AT ONCE.”

Well, that settles that.  Maybe if you had done some recon at the main Knottie camp at the ruins, you’d have an idea of something you could say that would convince them to let you in.  But as it stands you’ve got nothing.

Yes, it’s working!  No trouble at all.

All you can do is squirm against the powerful grip of the adhesive tape, finding it impossible to sunder with brute strength alone.  If only you had something sharp to cut it with!

You recall the runic dagger Vhaja entrusted you with.  That would do the trick!  But all your gear was evaporated… or was it?  Glancing to the side, you find that out of pure luck, your pack where you keep all your important adventuring supplies survived disintegration, probably because the strap holding it was vaporized before the main pouch, causing it to fall away from your body.  That’s good, since the data collection device needed for the mission is in there.  Along with the knife!  

Slowly, you start to wiggle along the ground towards your bag, wondering why the drones are letting you make it this far.  Though to your surprise, when you glance upwards, you see that they appear to have gone inert.  Did something switch them off?  You can’t be sure, but it’s a fortunate stroke of luck that you won’t waste.  Moving like a wriggling worm, you reach the bag and manage to get it open with your chin, finding the knife inside and dropping it down onto the floor.

“Hrmmphhfggh?” you mutter into the tape gag over your lips, glancing at Revissa.

“Hey can you help me with this?” helpfully translates the gag-talk device.

With a nod, your wife squirms over as well, and together you manage to use your bodies to manipulate the knife’s blade towards the silvery tape and slice your wrists free from the bonds.  The rest is simple, and soon you’ve managed to escape, though your clothing is gone.  Good thing you have those matter synthesizer capsules Jyumon gave you in your bag as well.

Revissa is no better off than you.  A slightly duller color of tape was used to wrap her up, but it’s just as effective in rendering her helpless.  Like you, she’s mummified from the feet up to the lips, with only a little window for chest and tail to poke out of.  That is, of course, standard bondage protocol, since binding up the breasts could restrict air flow and cause harm to the target.  The whole point of tying someone up is to trap them, not hurt them.  And well… the two of you are quite thoroughly, completely, trapped.

Though, now that you think about it, doesn’t the tape smell a bit like the tree resin you found on your way over here?  Is the adhesive locally sourced?  That would mean the tape has the properties of the planet’s unique Ghost Matter - namely, that you could be kept wrapped up indefinitely without the need of food, water, or other health services.  You wouldn’t even age a day!

“HEALTH SCAN COMPLETE.  TARGETS ONE AND TWO, GHOST MATTER PROTOCOLS CONFIRMED.  NO FURTHER INTERACTION NECESSARY.  TRANSFERRING TARGETS TO LONG-TERM STORAGE UNITS.”

Well, that confirms what you had just figured out all on your own.  But wait… what’s this about long term storage?

With surprising power for such little droids, the robots spool out one last length of tape to stick to your bodies, and then use that to hoist you both up and carry you off to a remote corner of the cargo hold.  You and Revissa struggle and squirm with all your might, of course, but you make no progress at all of even loosening their hold on you.  It’s abundantly clear that both of you are well and truly helpless.  

The long-term storage unit proves to be a long, rectangular shipping crate - one with just enough room to fit two helplessly mummified captives.  Once you are in place over the box, the droids line the two of you up, pressing you in against each other so your breasts squish together nicely.  And then they apply one more layer of tape to bind you up against one another, even going so far as to wind a single loop around the back of your heads so your gagged lips touch in an ineffective kiss.  And once that is done, you’re slotted into the box, where some heavy metal clamps snap around your bodies to prevent you from even doing so much as wiggling.

“TARGET STATUS: SECURE.  INFORMING COMMAND OF CAPTURE STATUS…

Wait… what?  One little communication error and they’re going to lock you away… forever?  And hide you someplace no one will ever find you?  You’d love to voice your opinion on that matter to the droids, but you’re not capable of making any sounds at all.  So all the two of you can do is wriggle and moan uselessly as the lid of the storage container snaps shut, and you hear a series of powerful locks snap into place.  The two of you are thus plunged into absolute darkness, with no way to communicate other than plaintive grunts and groans.  Then you feel the box rumble and shake, and get lifted up off the ground, carried through the air to places unknown.

Extreme stuff… normally only practiced by certain fundamentalist sects.  The Vida’chee is the more common form of the contest that’s just done for fun, but… I don’t think that’s what that was…”

This doesn’t seem particularly relevant to the task at hand, but potentially good to know for future interactions with the Knotties.  Are there potentially some hyper-fundamental bondage enthusiasts among their ranks?  That might put Krysta and Lumina in danger if their negotiations go south.  Something to keep in mind for later.  For the time being, however, there doesn’t seem to be anything more worth investigating in this building.

Freezium, of course, is a metal alloy that has the curious property of turning into a gas at low temperatures.  It has many uses, but the most iconic one is to spray down women to quickly encase them in the metal as it hardens at room temperature, bonding with their bodies and forming a solid structure in the shape of the frame built around them, which is usually a long, rectangular slab.  Though common in use throughout the galaxy, the Knottie people have always been known to have a strange affinity for it, despite their predilection towards bondage.

Investigating the slab, you find the containment frame is password-protected, so you won’t be able to just input a thawing sequence to free the woman inside.  If you had to guess, she was either a trophy owned by one of the workers in the outpost, or maybe she *is* one of the workers, and had this done to her as some kind of punishment.  Either way, in the adjoining room of the building you find a small freezium chamber as well that seems to be in working order.  It’s too bulky to drag around with you, but it’s good to know it’s here if you find yourself in need of frosting anyone over.

Though you do get a surprise when you accidentally slam your knee into a crate while searching its contents.  You let out a light grunt of annoyance, and get a response from an electronic device nearby, which says “Dammit!” in a calm, robotic voice.

Curious, you pick up the device and look it over, trying to get it to speak again, but nothing you do seems to prompt any response.  Revissa, however, happens upon a solution.  As you puzzle with its controls, she sneaks behind you, then suddenly jams a ball-gag she found in a box between your lips.

“Hrggmmpg hrrmm?” you yell in surprise.

“What the hell are you doing?” chimes in the device helpfully.

Revissa nods in approval.  “It’s a gag-talk translator,” she explains.

You enjoy a kinky bondage session as much as the next gal, but the Knotties take it to the next level with the amount of technology and culture dedicated to the pursuit of restraint.

Revissa finds a report on a nearby inventory console.  “It says here… the items are defective because they… *don’t* disintegrate the subject’s clothing before tying them up,” she says with a slight chuckle.

After all, freezium slabs always come with a built-in thawing mechanism.  And so, you drag Ros’eela’s crate over towards the freezing device, taking a moment to familiarize yourself with the controls.

The device takes the form of a six-foot tall cylindrical chamber, equipped with canisters of sublimated metal gas to do the freezing, and colonies of nanomachines to assemble the display frame used to contain the subject.  A hatch swivels open in the front, revealing the cramped interior in which a rectangular structure reminiscent of a doorway rests in the middle.  Restraints and shackles line the sides, a contrivance meant to ensure the positioning of an unwilling volunteer for the freezing process.  Considering how wiggly the latex-encased knottie is, you figure you’ll probably need to use them.

Though you’re by no means a tech wiz, you’re still better at this sort of stuff than Revissa, so you pilot the controls while your wife sets about prying open the crate and getting Ros’eela into position.  When the case creaks open, you find the pink-skinned girl just as utterly helpless as before, writhing powerlessly beneath the grip of the goopy black slime.  Revissa quickly uses her magic to conjure some vines to curl around the slimy mass and yank it and its captive host into the freezium chamber, quickly locking her in place within the frame.

“Now!” she yells, leaping away from the opening.

You nod and press the button to begin to process.  The hatch to the chamber slides shut, and you hear the whooshing of air as sublimated metal is sprayed over the knottie and the slime.  After a moment, a pleasant ding indicates the process is done, and you press the button to open up the chamber.  What you see inside is a pleasant surprise.

Ros’eela is frozen solid, naked body nicely mounted on a rectangular frame, completely embedded into the thick mass of mottled metal.  That was to be expected.  But more important than that is how she is posed.  Her hands are held out in front of her in the very traditional style of freezium victims, indicating that she must have been freed from the slime in order to move her arms to get into that position.  Which means that the goop must have been destroyed by the icy blast!

Satisfied with your ingenuity, you affix a hover-pad to Ros’eela’s body to move her, and hang her up on the wall beside the other one already there.  Unfortunately, it will not be safe to thaw her out for the next few hours at least, so she’ll have to remain trapped there for the time being while you figure out your next move.

As you ponder, you hear a beeping sound coming from the freezing device.  Looking around its back, you see that its freezium capsule has been expended and needs to be replaced.  Being the diligent technician that you are, you locate another one in a nearby crate and slot it into the machine… which is when a thought strikes you.  Though it’s not their main function, one could, theoretically, chuck one of these capsules like a grenade, shattering it at the feet of an enemy to flash-freeze them with the exploding vapor.  Definitely a useful thing to have in your back pocket.  And so you slip the last remaining capsule from the crate into your pouch and return to the mission.

If or when the Knotties are saved, you wouldn’t want them to be upset with you for using their equipment improperly.  And so, you bring up the manual for the device on its control console and look over the maintenance protocols listed.  It only takes a few minutes to go down the checklist, but the last bullet point requires you to head inside and ensure all the spray nozzles are properly cleaned of metal residue from their icy discharge. 

And so you pop inside and get to scrubbing, really getting in there to make sure everything is in top working order.  But as you work, your foot happens to bump into something hard lodged in the back of the chamber, causing it to roll backwards and klunk against the inner wall.

“Hrmm?”

You put down the tool you were using to clean, bending down to pick up the offending object.  It appears to be a small metal orb, about three inches in diameter, almost perfectly smooth and spherical.  Puzzled, you show it to Revissa, who lays a hand on it as well.

“Wait… whatever this is, it’s alive!” she exclaims.

“Alive?  But what could – wait!  Do you think… is this the slime symbiote?!”

Of course, it all makes sense.  While Ros’eela was getting frozen, it must have sloughed off her body, trying to escape the grip of the icy vapors.  But there was nowhere to run in the airtight capsule, so it collapsed in on itself and was encased in hardened metal, just like the Knottie.  Though… as you run your fingers along it more closely, you get the sense that the coating is rather thin.  A heavy impact would probably sunder the casing and free the slime monster, causing trouble for anyone nearby.

That makes it a useful, albeit dangerous, tool.  You stow it in your pack along with the freezium canister and head back out into the camp.

The only reason Ros’eela escaped capture by the pollen spitting plant was because she was unable to act on the impulses to head towards it while she was in the midst of her bondage training.  If she had been fully mobile when her arousal was at its highest, she’d have been helpless to resist its allure, and would have ended up like all the rest of the workers at the outpost.  So maybe… a bit of self-bondage is just what you need.

You could activate the ropes and restrain yourselves, working through your sexual tension until you’re no longer unbearably horny, and then escape from the bindings with some of your equipment, since these malfunctioning ropes won’t destroy your gear.  It’s an odd plan… but not totally insane.

“Oh, I agree,” you say, “but some of the best ideas are the insane ones.”

Your wife just rolls her eyes as you inspect the equipment.  Some ropes, ball gags, and leather collars - pretty standard stuff, as far as bondage material goes.  From the look of it, you can’t see any obvious flaws in the design or anything, but then again, you’re no expert in the field.

“Welp, here goes nothing.”

You find a button and press down on it, and immediately, the gear all springs to life.  The ropes animate like a nest of writhing snakes, wrapping around your ankles, your shins, and your thighs, tugging your legs out from under you and dropping you into a sitting position on the floor.  More of them catch your arms, forcing them behind your back one over the other then anchoring them to a loop secured around your waist in a box tie position.  You’re surprised by the thoroughness of these supposedly ‘defective’ products, how swiftly and completely they cut off your mobility.  But the ropes aren’t done there, with one last set twisting around your hips and digging themselves into your crotch, pressing in hard enough to make you gasp in unexpected arousal.  And that’s the opening the restraints need for one of the ball-gags to animate and quickly jam itself between your lips, securing its strap tightly around the back of your head.

Beside you, Revissa is overwhelmed in an identical manner, brought to the floor as her limbs become hopelessly entangled in the thick grip of the ropes.  She starts to make a snarky comment about how dumb an idea this was on your part, but the words never pass her lips before another gag seals off her voice.  Both of you find yourselves completely incapacitated in a matter of moments, reduced to squirming and grunting helplessly on the floor of the room.  But there’s still one last trick up these nefarious items’ sleeves, as leather collars shoot out and lock themselves around your necks, linking the two of you together with a thick strap between them.

“Mmmphhh!” you mewl in surprise, unable to comprehend how you could have been rendered helpless so quickly.

“Grrmpphh…” Revissa grumbles, having expected this from the beginning.

Though there is one silver lining.  Namely that your original idea did have some merit.  As you both spend an hour squirming uselessly, you feel that pollen scent waft in from the windows and drive you both into a frenzy of arousal, compelling you both to squirm and strain and struggle to try and make your way towards its source.  But bound as you are, any sort of mobility is impossible.  All you accomplish is driving yourself to a humiliating orgasm as the crotch rope digs into your lower lips and stimulates you enough to moisten your pants.

It’s only after you’ve fully worked out your frustration that you remember that you have a tool to help you among the items in your back.  Wiggling and squirming as best you are able, you eventually manage to withdraw Vhaja’s runic dagger from within your pouch and slide it out onto the floor.  And then, with the help of the gag-talk translator, the two of you coordinate your movements well enough to eventually cut your legs free, and then finally your hands.  It takes a full hour to get it done, and none of it would have been possible if you didn’t have your equipment, or if there wasn’t a tiny bit of give in the restraints since it was pressed up against the fabric of your clothes.  Which makes you shudder to think of how helpless you would have been if the restraints weren’t defective.

But in the end you are free, and your minds both feel more clear than they had been in a while, perhaps making it safer to traverse the outpost as you search for answers.

She’s bound up, suspension-style, with some incredibly taut ropework, loops of sturdy hemp around her arms, legs, thighs, and midsection, all connected to a pulley hanging from the ceiling that keeps her hanging in the air.  Additional armbinders and feet sheathes prevent her from using any of her twenty digits from manipulating her restraints, and there’s even a pair of anti-grav rings pressed over the tips of her head tendrils to keep them locked into a stable position relative to her body.  A big rubber ball gag held in place with a sturdy leather strap completes the ensemble, ensuring what, at least for you or Revissa, would be an intensity of bondage you couldn’t possibly hope to escape from.

But she’s not interested in listening.  She swerves her body, somehow managing to smack herself into you and cause you to drop the gag, then she catches it with her mouth and twists her neck to get it to fasten itself back in place.  It would be impressive if it wasn’t so annoying.

“I don’t think we’re going to get through to her like this,” Revissa says with a shrug.

“Mmph?” Ros’eela replies brightly.  “Mggrgmphh-rrgmmmph.”

As she grunts into her gag, the translation device you picked up in another room helpfully hums to life, and begins to interpret her random sounds into comprehensible speech.

“Huh?  Is that Captain Melfy?  It’s been too long!” is what the device tells you she said.

You give her a brief run-down of your mission thus far, and ask her about the Knottie outpost and what their purpose is here.  It’s more or less what you expected, that they are harvesting the natural resources made of ghost matter on this planet to repurpose into bondage gear.  Revissa remains upset that they would plunder the forest, forcing you to run interference as a mediator between the two of them.

“Look, if you’ve got a problem, take it up with the forewoman, not me,” Ros’eela eventually says in exasperation.

“Forewoman?  You’re the only person we’ve found in the outpost thus far!” you reply.  

That does surprise her somewhat.  She says there should be twenty or so workers around right now, but suggests that maybe they are doing recon in the forest, or maybe just headed back to the main camp by the ruins.  Since she’s spent the last few weeks doing bondage training in this closet, she doesn’t actually have much insight to offer.  You spend some more time trying to convince her to accompany you, but she remains determined to continue her training.

Revissa is not entirely convinced this is a sane and rational choice to be making right now, but she goes along with it anyway, perhaps only for the reason that the thought of watching you squirm against some ropes is deeply erotic to her.  

And so, as Ros’eela watches with bemused interest, the two of you peel off your clothes, and gather some self-tying smart-ropes from elsewhere in the building.  Then you drag a pair of chairs into the storage room, clearing out enough space so the two of you can sit beneath the Knottie’s suspended body.

“Why exactly are we doing this?” Revissa asks, but you cut her off by pressing a bright green ball gag between her lips.

Honestly, you’re not sure why you’re doing this.  But it does make you oddly wet, thinking about how completely helpless you and your wife are going to be in a moment.  You secure your own lips with a similar bright red gag, then sit down onto one of the chairs.  With a glance towards your wife, you both tug on the smart-ropes at the same time, activating their programming to command them to start coiling around your naked, unprotesting figures.  They move with expert precision, snaking around your ankles, above and below your knees, pulling your arms behind your backs and coiling between and around your heaving breasts.  And once they are in place, they tighten, pulling themselves taut in a way that immediately makes clear you’re not going to be able to get out of this on your own.  Perhaps most distracting of all, however, is the fact that they also wind themselves between your legs, rubbing erotically against your crotch in a way that makes you mewl in pleasured surprise into your gag.

Pulling out your trusty sword, you completely sever the ropes keeping her suspended in a few expertly aimed slashes, dropping the pink cutie to the ground.

“What the hell?!” she yells, as she starts to pick up the scraps of rope you just destroyed. 

“Look, we need to talk to you!” you plead.  “There’s something going on in this outpost - it’s totally deserted, other than you.”

Ros’eela continues to fiddle with the ropes as she looks up at you.  “That’s impossible.  There were like twenty people here when I started my training two weeks ago.”

You shake your head.  “While, now there’s no one here.”

“I guess I should take a look,” she says, before making one last tug on the ropes.  And suddenly, they spring to life, whatever damage you did to them repaired, and quickly twist around your and Revissa’s bodies, binding you back-to-back as you slink to the ground.

“Punishment for ruining two weeks worth of work,” she says, before turning and leaving the room.

Luckily, the ropes are damaged enough that you’re actually able to squirm free purely with brute strength, though it still takes you a good fifteen minutes of effort.  There’s no immediate sign of Ros’eela as you exit, meaning you’re going to have to look around for her all over again.

Ros’eela hangs above you, a bemused expression on her face, perhaps happy just to have the company.  And as you sit here, completely cut off from the outside world in your tiny little storage closet, you find the erotic tension that had slowly been building up in your body to subside.  You remain bound for the full extent of an hour before, with a deep sigh, Ros’eela finally decides to do something.

It’s honestly quite impressive to behold.  The way someone so completely restrained can twist and gyrate and squirm with such expert technique and precision to somehow loosen, then unfurl the ropes so snugly wound around her body.  But Ros’eela does just that.  For something that would have been beyond impossible for you, she accomplishes it in about five minutes, untying herself and landing on the ground like an acrobat after a gymnastics routine.

“So… you think there’s trouble in the air, eh?” she says after pulling out her gag.

You and Revissa nod.

“And I guess you wanna fix it?”

“Mmmphh…” you murmur gruffly.  “Hrbmpgghhh.”

“Sheesh, such foul language,” Ros’eela says with mock disgust, apparently perfectly capable of deciphering where exactly you told her she should stick her head tendrils.

A few minutes later, you and your wife are untied and dressed back up, ready to take on the rest of the mystery.  Ros’eela puts her clothes on as well, doing some warmup stretches and practice swings with her weapon of choice.

Ros’eela spent most of her early adulthood in the slave harem of galactic crime lord Sleeza the Slooze.  However, she eventually tired of that and conspired to escape, along with her fellow slaves, though not before stealing a magical sword from her old boss’s treasure vault.  Said sword turned out to be cursed, however, holding within it the bloodthirsty soul of a pirate queen named Jela which promptly possessed her.  Over time, however, they came to an arrangement, such that the pirate only gets control when there’s a fight.  Last you heard, Ros’eela went off to train at a Knottie monastery to gain even more control over the violent ghost, to keep it bound up within her soul to only be brought out when she specifically requested it.  Was this training you interrupted a part of that?

“Anyway, I’m still a bit stiff and drowsy,” she explains, “so I’ll mostly stay quiet and follow your lead, unless I see something I think I can help with.”

You nod.  It’s good to have the help.  With Ros’eela at your side, there’s surely more places you can get to in the outpost.

Knotties might find spiritual meaning in long-term captivity, but for you it’s mostly just boring.  Though at least the restraints seem to be made out of the planet’s Ghost Matter, meaning your physical needs are taken care of as you sit around in captivity.

It’s hard to tell time, locked in a storage closet, but after what you estimate to be a week of useless struggling, the door eventually opens to reveal a hovering security druid.  After scanning the room, it detects the three of you here, and makes an announcement in a loud, robotic voice.

“COMMAND HAS DECIDED TO ABANDON THIS OUTPOST,” it communicates with machine-like impassivity.  “ALL RESOURCES WILL THUS BE PUT INTO PERMANENT LOCK-DOWN.”

Wait… lock-down?  Permanent?  What does that mean?  Ros’eela seems to react with actual fear at this development, and frantically begins trying to squirm free of her bindings.  But the security drone moves faster, sending out some kind of signal to the electronically controlled ropes she had wrapped herself in.

“ADJUSTING ESCAPE DIFFICULTY TO LEVEL - IMPOSSIBLE.”

You can hear the ropes tightening around her, rendering even the bondage master helpless to escape.  The droid does the same to your own ropes, though you barely notice the difference, since you already couldn’t get out of even a basic-level tie.  Either way, once it is sure you are all totally secured, it floats away, leaving you and the rest of the ‘resources’ in the outpost unable to do anything but squirm.

It’s an ignominious end to an adventure that was already rather questionable in terms of the choices you made.  Because now you, your wife, and an old friend are locked away forever in a closet in an abandoned outpost, with no hope of escaping.  

For the first few weeks, you hold out hope that maybe the rest of your crew would somehow track you down.  But as the time passes, no one ever comes.  Maybe they got captured elsewhere by some other peril on this planet, or maybe they simply weren’t able to find you and were forced to leave.  Either way, it seems like a single poor decision is going to be the last one you ever make, because now the rest of your life is going to be spent here, bundled up and forgotten.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="287" name="FC02JB" tags="" position="3625,225" size="100,100">After spending some more time wandering through the outpost, you’re starting to feel the effects of the pollen again.  You’d think it would get easier with time, but no, your mind is every bit as addled by the effects of the aphrodisiac as it was when you first stepped foot into this clearing.  So it seems you have no choice but to once again subject yourself to some self-bondage, lest you get so overwhelmed you wander towards the giant flower and end up encased in amber.

“Are we really doing this?  *Again*?” Revissa asks in exasperation, eyeing the box of forbidden bondage equipment suspiciously.

“What other choice do we have?” you counter.  “If we’re not tied up when we get overcome with horniness, we’ll be drawn to the flower.”

In the end, she’s forced to agree.  So you open the box and lay out the gear, making sure that your rope-cutting knife is safely tucked into your belt, easily within reach.  You don’t need to waste another two hours in bondage - you just need to be able to safely orgasm without being pulled towards your doom.  

“Well, here goes nothing!” you yell, pressing down on the button to the rope.  And, like before, it springs to life like a hempen snake, swiftly curling around your limbs.

A familiar rush of erotic pleasure washes over you as you tumble to the ground, moaning with delight as the ropes start to press themselves against your skin.  In a moment you’re totally restrained, arms behind your back, legs bent, body churning against the taut lines digging into your crotch.  But then… something different happens.  The bristles on the rope begin to sizzle and glow, tiny nano-fibers shifting to activate a function that was supposed to be out of order, and in no time flat, every scrap of clothing is evaporated from your body, leaving you totally naked and completely without a viable weapon.

“Wha?” you murmur in confusion, before an animated gag slaps itself between your lips, sealing away your voice.

At this point your grunts of arousal give way, briefly, to fear, but they are incomprehensible since the gag-talk translator was destroyed along with everything else in your pack.  But that panic doesn’t last long, as a pair of stimulation devices emerge from the container, slipping themselves into your sex and switching on to the maximum setting.  You’re so overwhelmed from the sensation, you don’t even notice as spools of tape wrap around your hands, turning them into useless mittens that would be unable to pick up a tool to cut yourself free, if you had one.

You would answer… but you’re a bit distracted by other things at the moment.  If you weren’t, you might have noticed a second set of ropes slithering towards your flustered wife.

“Ack!” is all she can say, before they are upon her.  Revissa puts up as much of a fight as you did when you were caught - which is to say, no fight at all.  In a matter of seconds she’s been thrown to the ground, clothing and gear dissolved, naked skin completely bundled up in rope.

All you can do is let your eyes roll back and surrender to it.  At some point, the two sets of bondage gear decide to link up, attaching a strap between the collars around each of your necks to link the two of you together, to force you both to keep adding to the other’s stimulation by combining your body heat into a single, pulsating, thrumming nexus of bliss.

It seems this batch wasn’t all defective.  Because these ropes are working properly in completely dominating the both of you, reducing you to bundled up captives with no chance in hell of ever escaping your plight.

If or when the Knotties are saved, you wouldn’t want them to be upset with you for using their equipment improperly.  And so, you bring up the manual for the device on its control console and look over the maintenance protocols listed.  It only takes a few minutes to go down the checklist, but the last bullet point requires you to head inside and ensure all the spray nozzles are properly cleaned of metal residue from their icy discharge. 

All the work makes you build up quite the sweat.  As you move to wipe some of it from your brow, you can’t help but notice Revissa lounging against the entrance to the chamber with a sultry smile on her lips.  

“Enjoying the view?” you ask, flexing a bit for her.

“Always,” she says with a low purr.

You’ve never been able to resist her when she gets that look in her eyes.  Especially not now, when all that pollen in the air has been making you excessively horny.  So can you really be held responsible when you make a big show of sliding out of your shirt to let her ogle your rippling muscles as you get back to work?  And can *she* really be to blame for taking the bait and coming inside, for pressing herself up against you alluringly, for feeling the tautness of your toned abdomen against her skin?  

How could you have possibly known that freezium chambers of Knottie design have a lever *inside* the machine that activates the cooling process?  Their design philosophy as a species really does seem to be all about finding ways to imperil themselves, doesn’t it?  Of course, if you *had* known about that lever, you might have been able to muster up enough self-restraint to avoid it, but instead when Revissa starts nibbling on your ear you reach up for something to wrap your fingers around and accidentally give it a tug.

If there’s any silver lining, it’s that what happens next comes so quickly you don’t really have time to fully realize how monumental of a screw-up you had just made.  The hatch swings shut, the machine hums to life, and super-chilled metal vapor flows from the recently-cleaned nozzles with frightening efficiency, washing over the bodies of you and your wife just as you pull her in to lock lips.  And then there’s only an immense feeling of cold, the sound of clothing becoming brittle and flaking away, the hiss of steam and the hum of electronics, and then nothing at all as you’re locked into a state of suspended animation.

The hatch opens when the machine finishes powering down, revealing a pair of lovers perfectly preserved in solid metal, locked into a metal display frame custom-built to contain their moment of passion.

And so you stand, helplessly encased, unmoving, unseeing, unthinking.  Frozen and trapped.  A series of mishaps have led you to this point, a flurry of poor choices and hapless oversights.  But now, nothing you do or say has any impact on what happens to you next, because freezium-coated cuties have no agency of their own.

Maybe they got caught by some other peril on the planet, or maybe they searched for as long as they could before eventually giving up.  You’ll never know.

It’s several hundred years before you’re discovered by chance by a passing explorer.  The prefab buildings have mostly crumbled and withered away, reclaimed by the elements, only a few vine-choked walls remaining of the doomed outpost.  But freezium doesn’t decay, so you and Revissa and the two helpless Knotties are as solid as the day you were first preserved, inert slabs of metal caked in dirt and moss.  

Had you been lucky, you’d have been found by a kind soul.  But luck was never your strong suit.  You’re found by a pirate, who sells you and the others to a private collector, where you’re mounted on the walls of her private gallery. She has no intention of ever letting you go, so she removes the display frame from the freezium slab, which also has the mechanism to thaw you out, and also coats you in some glossy sealant that makes restoration significantly more difficult.  

And so begins your new life as nothing but a bauble in someone’s collection, put on display without any knowledge of who you were or what you had done.  In the end, one thoughtless mistake ended your entire career, erased your mark on history, and doomed you and your wife to an eternity of suspended animation.

As your fingers fumble for clasps and buttons, tugging at cloth and pulling at boots, undoing the buckle on a belt and dropping your earthly possessions to the forest floor.  Petal watches with interest as you and Revissa disrobe, helpfully flinging droplets of her nectar onto your discarded items to dissolve them into steam.  How kind of her - after all, you won’t be needing any of that stuff anymore.  Clothes and weapons and data devices are trappings of your old life, equipment whose purpose you no longer even remember.  All that matters now is to do what she tells you, to make her happy, to bring a smile to her wonderful face.

“I like the looks of your bodies,” she says warmly, long plant tendrils extending from her flower home to gently caress your exposed figures.  “But I bet the two of you like each other even more than that.”

A tender nudge of a vine directs you and Revissa to look into each other’s eyes.  And a puff of pollen against your nostrils and a droplet of sweet nectar between your lips is all that it takes to inform you of what it is you must do.  With sluggish, but confident steps, you move towards your wonderful wife, wrapping your arms around her waist as both of you drop to your knees.  Warm bodies meld into a single entity, hungry lips eagerly joining together as you lose yourselves in each other’s embrace.

You are vaguely aware of more honeyed words from the beautiful plant-woman, but you’re too busy exploring Revissa’s heaving body to give them any mind.  As such, you are not prepared for the steady drip-drip-drip of fragrant plant sap as it pours over your body - not that it really matters anyway.  Because you know what you need to do.  You need to keep kissing, keep grinding, keep moaning, even as that deluge of nectar starts to congeal and harden, even as it forms an impenetrable amber shell to encase your bodies and preserve you in your moment of unbridled passion.

Presumably, there are still things happening outside.  The Knottie outpost becomes abandoned after all its occupants lost contact with the main camp.  And your own crew never shows up to extract you, though whether that is because they simply have no idea where you were, or that they have fallen afoul of some other peril on the planet is impossible to tell.

Either way, the fact remains, that you and Revissa remain here, ummoving, and mostly unthinking.  The lovely plant lady who put you here seems to have moved on to greener pastures, happy to have fertilized the soil with all the runoff from your resin-coated sexual tension - not that you’re aware of that being her reasoning.  And as the days go on, all blending into one another, stretching on into infinity, that is all you’ll ever be, just another block of amber left alone in the deep, deep forest.

It’s not until many months later that your amber shell finally thaws out, and you and Revissa are able to collapse into each other and melt into a puddle of orgasmic bliss.  Later, you’ll learn that thanks to your Star Scout homing beacon, Vhaja and the rest of the crew were able to track you down and extract your amber-encased bodies from the forest.  Though after that it took a long process of searching for a way to actually remove you from the nigh-indestructible nectar.  Eventually you were brought to the Squira druids of Del Thora, a remote planet whose trademark sacred sap has many similar properties to the plant resin, and with their techniques you were returned to life.

Of course, the rescue and restoration process meant the actual mission had to be abandoned, not the least reason for which is the data collection device was destroyed along with your gear and clothing.  And so as your crew breaks up again and goes their separate ways, you can only wonder how things might have gone had you been able to keep your libido in check.

And clearly, the bridge is always going to be the best place to start.  After confirming the location on the map, you and Revissa head there, finding the entrance at the end of the hallway.

As soon as you step through the door, you are assaulted by a sickly-sweet smell in the air, thick and cloying and almost mind-numbingly pleasant.  The culprit seems to be the ship’s air circulation system, because as you glance up at the air vents you can see there is some kind of plant growth coming in through it, full of beautifully flowering vines.  A powerful pollen wafts from the flowers, filling the room with a haze of yellowish dust, causing you to sneeze as you accidentally get a full whiff of it.

“This is… ahhh…” murmurs Revissa.  “Some kind of… aphrodisiac…”

“It’s real… nice…” you whisper in response, feeling an indescribable warmth filling your body.

It is at this point that you look down and discover what happened to cause Ros’eela to be delayed.  She breathed in the same pollen that the two of you did, and, overcome by horniness, appears to have activated some kind of emergency enviro-suit feature on the bridge, which has encased her body in a tight layer of plastic wrap.

Sealed in tight, her fingers play with her lower lips, while the upper ones are nicely fitted with a tight blue ball gag.  She looks up at you with half-lidded eyes, moaning helplessly as she succumbs to the intensity of the pleasure.

“Oh… wow…” you say weakly, already pawing at your clothes.  “That’s… really… hot…”

Revissa nods, slipping out of her garments and letting them drop to the floor.  “Do you think… you can… get that working for… us… too?”

You glance at the blinking light for the emergency enviro-suit dispenser.  It seems simple enough.  Just press the button and stand in front of it to get fitted.

Though overcome by arousal, you still have a measure of chivalry left in your mind, so you motion for Revissa to go in first.

Namely, that Ros’eela found a data pad near the construction equipment that she said had belonged to her boss, the ship’s captain.  You pull it out now, and page through the interface, finding a connectivity app that links to the ship’s main systems.  And though there aren’t any options to open just the one door to the room ahead of you, there *is* an option to initiate a total reboot of all containment measures, which will also unlock all restricted areas on the ship.

Well, that seems as good a choice as any.  You click the button and are rewarded with a satisfying hiss as the door whooshes open, allowing you to walk inside.

Of course, being the daring sort that you are, you step in first, walking into a room illuminated only by the sultry mood lighting of a lava lamp on a table next to a heart-shaped bed laying in the middle of the room.  Well then… it seems the captain of this ship is more of a lover than a fighter.  You spend a few minutes searching the chamber, but don’t end up turning up anything of use.  Disappointed, you’re about to turn and leave, when you notice a data stick sitting in the middle of the bed.  Jackpot!

Unfortunately… when you crawl onto the bed to retrieve it, you activate some kind of automatic function inherent to the piece of furniture.  Suddenly you see a clear film spreading out from the sides of the bed, wrapping over you and shifting your limbs into an embarrassingly open pose before you have a chance to react.  This is followed by a pulse of energy to evaporate your clothing (*again*), leaving you naked and utterly restrained in a vacuum-sealed sheathe atop the bed.

You sigh as you squirm helplessly against the material.  It would figure that this is how a Knottie captain would relax when she was off duty.  Revissa can barely contain her amusement as she watches you struggle, eventually deciding to add insult to injury by walking to the foot of the bed and pressing the end of her staff between your legs.  What follows is several minutes of intense stimulation that leads to you climaxing loudly and messily inside the plastic seal, which, ironically, proves to be exactly the right call.  Because as soon as you finish, the plastic automatically retracts, its job done, leaving you panting and exhausted atop the bed.

But at least you got that damn data stick.  After you clean yourself up and use another synthesizer capsule to repair your clothing, you insert the stick into a computer console and bring up the last few entries in the captain’s personal log files.  In them, she talks about the harvesting operations, quoting productivity metrics and the like, as well as her theories about some strange substance a scout team found in the cavern area that has some promising qualities to it.  However, she also complains about a dip in efficiency as her crew starts becoming increasingly horny as the days pass (even hornier than *normal* Knottie operations, you think to yourself bemusedly).  In the last entry, she says she has discovered the source of this horniness, that pollen from the local plants seem to have aphrodisiac properties, and that a particularly large one has just cropped up in the center of the clearing where they are working.  She says she’s going to send some crew to prune the offending plant, as well as get someone to work on the ship’s ventilation system since it seems to have gotten clogged up lately.

And that’s all the information you find.  Altogether not as useful as you might have liked, but at least now you know why you’ve been feeling so horny whenever you walk around outside, and that the large flower is the source of it.  Definitely something to keep in mind for the future.

But you still haven’t found Ros’eela.  So it seems like you’ll have to do some more searching.

Presumably, the suit-fitting process is meant to include some sort of helmet as well, since the wrapping stops when it climbs to Revissa’s neck.  But you see nothing to that effect nearby - or maybe the ball-gag Ros’eela is wearing is somehow the breathing apparatus?  You’re honestly not sure, and if you were thinking properly, you would wonder how exactly whatever this machine is doing would be a useful feature for a starship to have.  But you’re *not* thinking straight.  In fact, you’re barely able to contain your growing arousal as the bound-up Revissa flops over onto the floor next to Ros’eela, moaning passionately as she pleasures herself in her bondage.

You can think of nothing else but wanting to join her.  And so, you walk up to the machine as well, frantically pounding on the button to dispense a lovely cling-film of your own.  But perhaps you shouldn’t have hit it so hard.  Because instead of getting a spinning layer of film wrapped around your legs, the machine instead spits out a thick, net-like sheet of plastic at high velocity, a rectangular mat of clear film that slams into you with enough force to knock you back against the wall.  When you strike the surface the plastic net sticks there, held in place by powerful adhesives that effectively glue you into place in a tidy, vacuum-sealed sheathe.]

But on the other, the incredible pressure of the tightly sealed plastic hugging your every curve feels *amazing*.  In fact, you find you’re able to stimulate yourself just by gyrating your body and massaging your skin against the material, prompting you to roll your eyes back and moan as you reach the first of many climaxes.

And so, the three of you completely succumb to the unintentionally laid trap on the bridge, naked, restrained, and unable to concentrate on anything other than pleasure for even a moment, giving you no time to even consider the prospect of escape.  Which means none of you will be going anywhere else any time soon.

“Ohh… that looks… fun…” Revissa murmurs, her legs quivering.  She begins pawing at her clothing, desperate to have what Ros’eela is having.

And you have to admit… it *is* pretty hot.  But your head is still on straight enough to realize that self-bondage on a Knottie starship is not exactly the best idea, especially when you’re in the middle of a mission.  Though if you hadn’t just been stimulated to completion in the captain’s quarters, you might not have had the presence of mind to realize it.

The important thing, you decide, is getting your allies away from that horniness dust.  And so you scoop Ros’eela up in your arm and sling her over your shoulder, then take Revissa by the hand and lead her away.  When you duck into the quarters you just exited, she gets an excited look in her eye, making you realize too late the idea you were giving her.  Before you can react your wife has pounced on top of you, slathering you with touches and kisses that make your mind blank out entirely.  But at least you did it while not in the room filled with pollen, so that after a half hour of love-making everyone’s feeling a bit more level-headed.

You eventually get yourself dressed again, and manage to cut Ros’eela out of her plastic seal.

Good thing you didn’t join her, otherwise there wouldn’t be anyone left to get you free.  

“I’d have loved to have brought up the security footage so that we could have seen what happened to everyone else, but with the bridge full of pollen like that, I don’t think I’ll be able to concentrate long enough to put in the codes for it,” Ros’eela continues.  “Oh, but wait… you have the captain’s data pad, right?  In that case, maybe we can transfer command authority from the bridge here to her quarters.”

You hand her the device and let her do just that.  With a few clicks, she accomplishes her goal, and manages to bring up some camera recordings from the past few weeks.

What you’re met with is a scene of complete chaos.  From the look of it, the lab was repurposed from crew quarters, given the alcoves in the wall that look like they were once bunk beds.

Which means the various living critters that had been kept inside are free and skittering around like wild, small animals darting every which way and clusters of bugs scurrying towards dark corners.  And all of them seem to be trying to escape from one thing in particular.]

At first you just think it’s some kind of puddle of oil or tar that has spilled out onto the floor.  But then you see that the puddle of black gunk isn’t remaining stationary.  It’s moving, flowing around the room, oozing in directions that aren’t randomly determined, but chosen with deadly purpose.  A small, fuzzy woodland creature gets overtaken by the blob and coated with the thick tar, which clings to the critter like glue and forms a firm rubber shell around its body.  And then the critter falls to the floor and writhes, completely encased and immobilized by the goopy menace.

Not good.  This thing must be some kind of slime-like predator!  Leave it to the Knotties to keep something so dangerous locked up in a lab that could be released with a single accidental press of a button.

“We need to do something!” Revissa yells, pulling out her staff and preparing a spell.

You nod at her, attempting to draw your sword.  But before your hand even curls around the hilt, the ooze monster suddenly changes direction, perhaps picking up on the sound of your voices.  It flows with terrifying quickness towards the two of you, even somehow ejecting some globs of itself from its main mass at high velocity towards your bodies.  You don’t even have time to process what’s happening before a gob of rubbery sludge catches you by the wrist, preventing you from getting a hold of your weapon.

“Wha — grrmmphg!” Revissa yells in surprise, as a similar projectile gloms over her lips, cutting off her ability to finish casting her spell.

Crap, there’s no explanation for why it targeted the two of you that way other than that this black puddle of moving tar is somehow intelligent!  And that it sees the two of you as potential prey.

“We need to get out of here!” you tell, using your good hand to take Revissa by the wrist and pull her back towards the door you came in through.

But the slime monster is faster.  It races ahead of you, sloshing its way between you and the exit, cutting off your retreat.  Not good at all.  Your mind races, wondering whether it would be smarter to make a run for it and try to barge past it, or back away and try to find something in the lab to help you fight it. 

Sadly, it becomes a moot point.  Because once it has limited your movement, the slime goes in for the kill.  It oozes upwards, forming itself into a kind of thin, rectangular sheet of dribbling rubber, high enough to stretch itself fully between the floor and ceiling, and then it rushes forwards.  

There’s nowhere to run.  The room is too cramped to avoid it.  It forms itself into a barrier of goop and advances, forcing both of you back against the wall.  All you can do is hold your hands up in a pathetic attempt at resistance before it melds itself over you, gluing you and your wife firmly against the surface behind you.  You feel a sickening splort as it molds itself in place, locking both of you inside of it and lifting you off your feet.

Knotties working with the heavy equipment to cut down and process the raw materials of the forest to be stored, shipped, and repurposed into bondage equipment.  Revissa seethes with annoyance as she watches the trees collapse, and as captured animals are taken to the slaughter, but manages to control herself enough to not turn into a dinosaur again.  Though you can tell that she’s really close to it.

After a while, you notice one of the workers suddenly just put down her tools and wander off, not saying a word to her compatriots, so you ask Ros’eela to change to a different camera log to follow her path.  She ends up wandering into the middle of the clearing, to the spot where you  saw that giant flower surrounded by hunks of amber.  However, in the recording, there’s no amber.  At least… not yet.  Before your eyes, you see the hapless Knottie start to disrobe, her body moving in a lethargic daze, and then stand there as coiling vines emerge from the flower and wrap around her.  She’s lifted up into the air, her eyes rolled back, her lips pursed in pleasure, as a slick nectar flows from the vines and coats her body.  After several minutes, that nectar hardens into a solid cluster of pure amber, fully encasing the woman inside of it like a prehistoric fly.  

“Well… that explains what happened to everyone…” Ros’eela says with a frown.  “I guess everyone was charmed by that plant and got gooped.  We’ve got to do something about this!  This is unforgivable - how dare those plants trap them without tying them up first”

Revissa grumbles.  “*That’s* what you’re upset about?”

“Look, I might not be the best example of my species, but even I have standards,” the Knottie replies.

You just shake your head in exasperation as you watch the video. 

“So it looks like the plants control people with their pollen.  That would explain why I’ve been so horny ever since I entered the area, even from a distance that pollen is affecting us.  And I guess that explains why Ros’eela was fine - she was tied up the whole time so she couldn’t get drugged into going towards the plant, even if she wanted to.”

“See?  My bondage training paid off!” Ros’eela says proudly.  “Anyway, it looks like if we get too close we’ll totally lose our minds, but we can’t save everyone if we don’t get close.  I wonder if there’s some way around that.  If you girls have any ideas, I’m all ears.  But for now I think I am going to hang back here and see if I can’t contact HQ for some help.”

That seems reasonable.  At this point, you could consider the mystery no longer your problem, since Ros’eela is calling it in to her bosses, though it would probably be the heroic thing to do to keep poking around.  And though she’s going to stay on the ship for the time being, Ros’eela would probably be willing to at least accompany you to the science lab before you head outside.

But of course she doesn’t get to finish her thought before the slime monster throws itself against her body and adheres tightly to her skin, clinging to her in a tight sheathe that cuts off any chance of movement.  You’re no expert, but you’re pretty sure even the best escape artist in the galaxy wouldn’t be able to just wriggle out of that.  Which means she won’t be able to help you now.  You watch as the monster completely envelops her, covering her face and head tendrils and dropping her to the floor as a squirming, writhing, latex-bound mummy.

Even with her caught, however, the monster doesn’t seem content to stop there.  Some of it sloshes off away from the cocooned Knottie, ready to snare you and your wife if you don’t act fast!

Just look at how it instantly caught Ros’eela like that!  Better to keep it contained for now, at least until you can figure out a better plan.  

Of course, actually accomplishing that is easier said than done.  But after you share your thoughts, Revissa comes up with a plan.  Breaking away from you, she transforms herself into an adorable green monkey, only about two feet tall, and begins leaping around the tables and equipment in the room, making a raucous shrieking sound and throwing random objects into the slimy creature’s body.  And that seems to have the intended effect of drawing its attention towards her, causing the monster to keep spitting goopy blasts of liquid rubber in her direction.  But as a monkey, she is faster.  She always manages to leap to the side at the very last minute, frustrating the relentless monster and making it reckless.  Until finally, the creature launches its entire gelatinous form at her, hoping by sheer volume it will be able to connect with her.

And it might have, had you not grabbed her by the tail and yanked her away right before it hit her, causing the monster to instead fly right into one of the containment cells.  Quickly you pull out the tablet and re-activate security protocols, once again trapping it inside an energy barrier.

Success!  Though that doesn’t help at all with rescuing Ros’eela.  Your pink friend is still entirely encased in a sheathe of latex, squirming helplessly in the creature’s grasp.  Sadly, you have no better ideas on how to proceed, so for the time being you have Revissa turn back to humanoid form and load the Knottie up into an air-tight storage crate, locking the lid shut with a hiss of steam.  Not the best solution, but the only one you can come up with at the moment.

And now it’s just the two of you again.  The question remains what to do about the pollen-spitting plant and the rest of the Knotties in the outpost, not to mention Ros’eela who is still helplessly writhing in the storage container.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="311" name="FC02IE" tags="" position="4750,1125" size="100,100">Before she got gunked, Ros’eela had said the slime creature had some kind of weakness.  Well, it would stand to reason that if it did, the people holding it here would have a way to target its weakness somewhere in the room.  Now if you could just find it, maybe you could get out of here.

“Revissa… try dumping some of these random containers on it and see if it reacts to anything!” you yell.

Your wife nods, conjuring plant vines to sprout up from the ground and grab onto various test tubes full of chemicals and crates with harvested materials, overturning them and dumping them into the gooey creature’s sticky mass.

As each object drops in, it gets absorbed with a sickening *splort*.  Some wood chip samples dissolve uselessly, as do several strips of dried and cured leather.  A vial of river water does nothing, nor does a hunk of amber.  Just when it seems like you’re out of luck, Revissa knocks over a small refrigeration unit onto the slime which, much to your delight, causes it to suddenly slow down in its movement.

“Wait… cold!” you yell.  Of course!  You vaguely recall a story from years ago about a slime symbiote that was weak to low temperatures.  This thing must work the same way.  Looking around, you see a feed line for some industrial coolant gas on the wall.  And you’re just about to point it out when something among the cocktail of chemicals within the slime creature causes it to violently erupt.

You and Revissa have only a moment to hold up your hands in surprise before a wave of sticky slime slams into you both and shoves you up against the wall, pinning you there beneath a thin but taut rubbery sheathe.  It holds fast, completely cutting off your movement, vacuum sealing you to the spot with no way to get out.

But up until now, you’ve ignored the giant flower in the center, surrounded by hunks of amber resin.  Maybe it was just some kind of sixth sense that warned you away from it, some deep-seated knowledge born from the many adventures you’ve survived up until now.  But whatever it is, after seeing the recorded footage on the ship, you know it was the right call.  If you got too close, you’d be overwhelmed by the scent of pollen and doused in quick-drying nectar, frozen in place with no chance of getting out on your own.

So given all that, one might find it rather puzzling why you would now choose to approach the giant flower.  But there’s nothing strange about it.  Despite everything, you do somewhat fashion yourself as a hero.  When push comes to shove, you try to do the right thing.  Revissa might not be happy with what these Knotties are doing to the forest, but they don’t deserve to be trapped forever like flies in amber.  So you’ve decided the only thing to do is to rescue them.  At least you know about the pollen, and that you need to keep your wits about you when the plant starts to try and lure you in.

“Hold on a moment,” Revissa says, lightly grabbing your wrist as you approach.  “Let me do a quick spell.”

She rifles through her bag for some bright red berries, then crushes them between her finger, reaching out to lightly brush some of the pulp on each of your foreheads.

“It only lasts for a few minutes, but it should make us a bit more resistant to mind-altering effects,” she explains.  “But *not* immune… so please try to keep your libido in check.”

“No promises,” you say with a smile, before you strut towards the center of the clearing towards the hunks of amber.

You knew what to expect, but you still have to stifle a gasp when you notice it.  Though the hardened chunks of sap are mostly opaque, when you get close enough you can see past the surface to what lies inside.  Each piece of resin holds a woman trapped inside of it, all of them bearing the distinctive head tendrils of the Knottie species.  The women are nude, and have expressions on their faces ranging from surprised, to relaxed, to aroused.  None of them are moving, which isn’t surprising, though at least they don’t appear to be in any immediate danger.  

“They’re alive,” Revissa confirms, laying her hand on the smooth surface of one of the amber stones.  “This is made of the same Ghost Matter as the rest of the stuff on this planet, so they’ll be safe and healthy for as long as they’re in there.”

“Can they be freed?” you ask, casting a suspicious eye around the area for any signs of movement from the flower that did this to them.

Revissa shakes her head.  “It’s… really strong stuff, I am pretty sure.  Conventional weapons would be useless against it.  But maybe the Squira priestesses of Del Thora would be able to do something.  They make use of a Sacred Sap in their rituals that has similar properties.”

On the one hand, they’re not stuck forever.  On the other, it means that there’s probably no tools you have in your arsenal here that can rescue anyone caught in the stuff.  Which means your best bet to finding out how to free them would be examining the flower itself.

It is exactly when that thought crosses your mind that you hear the rustle of leaves from behind you.  The sweet scent of pollen grows thicker and stronger, filling your nostrils with a fragrant aroma that sends your mind reeling - though Revissa’s blessing helps you resist the worst of it for now.  Turning around, you see the massive flower fronds start to unfurl from the center of the giant plant, revealing an unexpected sight at their center.

You feel the hair on your tail start to stand on end.  Despite the sensuality in the words, you can feel the threat posed by the voice.  Ahead of you, the giant flower fully unfurls, and within it you can see the body of the painfully beautiful woman that was hidden inside.

She has rich green skin, short, fluffy hair with the texture of leaves, and a curvaceous figure that extends down to the thighs before it vanishes into the center of the petals of the giant flower.  The interior of her flower is filled with more of that amber liquid, the same as the stuff all the Knotties are encased in, sloshing around whenever she moves, creating a powerful, honey-sweet scent even more overwhelming than the airborne pollen.  

Despite everything, you still find yourself speechless before her.  Every fiber of your being is telling you to submit, to surrender, to give yourself over to the bewitching plant woman.  Revissa seems a bit more equipped to answer, stepping forward with her arms held up diplomatically.

“Greetings, noble protector of the forest,” your wife says.  “We apologize for the intrusion.  And… I just want to let you know that we – that I, sympathize with your plight.  I know these women–” and here, she gestures vaguely towards the amber-trapped Knotties “--have caused harm to your home.  They have cut down trees, they have slain animals, they have disrupted the natural ecosystem.  They have intruded in a place where they do not belong–”

“Hrmm…” the plant woman says with a frown, interrupting her.  “It’s true… they didn’t belong here.  But it’s okay!  Now they do!  They’re part of the forest now, and they’ll stay that way forever!”

The use of the word ‘forever’ certainly sets off alarm bells.  Yet even still, you find yourself transfixed by her beauty.  Revissa, too, is struggling to maintain her composure.

“My name is Petal,” the woman says after a moment, reaching down to brush a hand over each of your cheeks.  “What are your names?”

“Melfy,” you murmur weakly.  You stare up, transfixed by the intensity of her eyes, the softness of her skin.

“Revissa Bloomtender,” your wife says more firmly.  She steps forward to interpose herself between you and the plant woman.

Petal tilts her head curiously to the side.  “Are you upset with me?” she asks, her voice dripping with what seems like sincere concern.

“No… not exactly,” Revissa murmurs, though even her voice is starting to waver.  Being this close to the source of that pollen is intoxicating.  “But… these women… you can’t just… keep them here.”

“Oh, is that all?” Petal says, relief evident in her voice.  “Don’t worry!  I completely can!  They won’t be going anywhere, but they’ll be safe, and happy, and useful!  Here, I’ll show you.”

You feel leafy vines begin to curl around your body, and you have just enough presence of mind to realize what she is saying.  She thought Revissa’s complaint was a question of practicality - that she couldn’t physically contain all those women safely - rather than a moral one.  And she’s about to prove it by doing the same to both of you!

Normally, your first instinct would be to prepare for battle, reach for your sword or blaster pistol, maybe snarl and bare your teeth in challenge.  But you do none of those things.  Instead, you just turn around, a placid smile on your face as your nostrils fill with a saccharine scent that dulls your senses and lulls you into a placid, compliant daze.  And you look up into a pair of beautiful, nurturing eyes.

“Hello…” you say happily.

“We’re sorry… for the intrusion…” Revissa adds weakly, her eyes as blank and submissive as yours.  “We were… trying to figure… what happened to these women…”

The two of you have completely fallen under the spell of this beautiful plant woman.  She has rich green skin, short, fluffy hair the texture of leaves, and a curvaceous body that extends down to the thighs before it vanishes into the center of the petals of the giant flower.  The interior of her flower is filled with more of that amber liquid, sloshing around whenever she moves, creating the powerful, honey-sweet scent that so effectively rendered you and your wife into compliant slaves.

Ros’eela looks between the two of you, realizing you’ve both become completely infatuated.  And though she’s been influenced by the mind-altering pollen as well, the sight of her compatriots trapped in amber gives her enough courage to start to reach for her sword.

“You… have to let them… go!” she demands, fumbling with the blade to activate the enchantment on it that lets it glow with spectral power.  But her movements are slow and sluggish, her resolve already starting to waver.

“Hrmm…” the plant woman says with a frown.  “It’s true… they didn’t belong here at first.  But it’s okay!  Now they do!  They’re part of the forest now, and they’ll stay that way forever!”

With a twitch of her head, a vine whips out from the base of her giant flower, quickly wrapping around Ros’eela’s legs and pulling her up into the air.  She lets out a yelp of surprise, dropping her blade in the confusion as tendrils snake around her body, ripping away her clothes and wrapping her up tightly as she is hung upside down in front of green woman&#39;s body.]

“But I understand that you’re worried for them.  I just want you to know that it’s okay.  They’ll be safe here, and happy!  And you can join them.”

All her bravado has faded away, reducing the Knottie to a weakly mewling captive, helpless and compliant.  A state that she only falls deeper into as the plant woman begins to slather one of her head-tails with some of her fragrant nectar.

“See?  This is how they feel right now.  How they’ll feel forever.  This isn’t so bad, right?”

She takes Ros’eela by the cheeks and looks deeply in her eyes, and the Knottie can only manage to nod weakly in agreement.  

“Wonderful!  Now, let’s get you inside.”

There is no further resistance as Ros’eela is dragged towards the amber chunk holding the other two of her kin.  The plant woman brushes a vine against the surface of the resin, somehow turning a portion of it to a gelatinous state.  This allows her to shove the pink-skinned woman inside, the honey-like stone accepting her as if she was always meant to be there.  The vine takes a moment to insert itself into Ros’eela’s lower lips, pleasuring her to climax before withdrawing.  When it leaves, the gooey portion solidifies once more, trapping the Knottie inside in a perpetual orgasm.]

“See?  That wasn’t so bad!’  She claps her hands, then turns towards you and Revissa.  

Despite the scene you had just witnessed, the two of you remain completely under her spell.  The very idea of resistance is unthinkable.  There’s nowhere you’d rather be than here, no one you’d rather be looking at than this gorgeous woman.

“My name is Petal,” the woman says after a moment, reaching down to brush a hand over each of your cheeks.  “What are your names?”

Slowly, you open your lips to tell her, but strangely, you can’t remember.  You can’t remember anything at all.  Why you’re here, where you came from - none of it.  And so you just stare blankly, an apologetic look on your face, sorry for letting her down.  But then she smiles, and its as if everything in the world is right again.

“Oh… that’s okay.  Names aren’t that important anyway.  Now why don’t we get you two out of those clothes, and then we can find a place for you to fit into this forest as well?”

It fills you with an indescribable joy, to know that Petal would want to allow you to remain here in the forest with her.  Even after you’ve been so rude, forgetting your name like that.  And so you readily comply, lamely fumbling with boots and belts and shirts and pants, dropping weapons and equipment that you no longer even know the purpose of.  When you’ve finally got everything off, Petal gives you a nod of appreciation that makes your heart swell with pride, and then makes a motion for you to hold still.  Of course, you comply.

You and Revissa stand there as long, leafy tendrils extend from the bottom of her flower, wrapping around you and tightly restraining your limbs.  They feel taut and secure, too strong for you to break out of - though that’s a moot point, since you’d never want to run away from your new favorite person in the world.  Looking between the two of you, she decides to start with your wife, hoisting her up into the air and then dunking her upside down into the center of the pool of sap inside her flower, making sure to cover every inch of her body.  When she’s pulled out, her face is in a placid state of relaxment, all ounce of tension or worry banished from her frame.  She draws Revissa in for a long, lusty kiss, then suspends her in the air, allowing more and more of her nectar to drip down her vines to continue coating her.

“And now it’s your turn,” she says brightly, the very sound of her voice filling you with an indescribable warmth.  

The vines holding you yank you upwards, getting no resistance from you as you’re brought in close.

“And down you go!”

As you’re dunked into her nectar, you feel the sweet amber liquid fill your throat, feel it drip down to your stomach then flow through the rest of your body to circulate the warmth and calmness it brings.  It makes you feel nothing but joy.  You sigh in delight as your worries, your fears, your life before this moment all melt away, leaving you as nothing but a vessel for pleasure and contentment as she draws you in for your kiss.]

Her lips are soft yet firm, warm and inviting, infinitely calming.  You surrender every aspect of your being to that kiss, give her all of what you are and ever will be.  She seems to enjoy that.  As she draws back from the kiss, she tenderly caresses your cheek, then casts her eyes around the clearing.

“Now then… where to put this one…”

[[Find the place where you belong-&gt;FC02CB]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="315" name="FC02M" tags="" position="4900,1000" size="100,100">Petal is so achingly beautiful.  Just looking at her makes your body burn with desire, and her voice is so soft and soothing.  You want to be with her; you *need* to be with her.  But… some part of you knows that’s just the aphrodisiacs talking.  That this close to her, your mind is not your own.  And beside you, you can see even Revissa is starting to fall prey to it.

It’s rare, but every once in a while, you find the strength to step up and fight back.  This is one of those times.  As Petal’s leafy vines begin to curl around the two of you, you realize if you don’t act fast, you won’t be acting at all.  So you reach for your sword and free it from its sheath, making a wide swing that severs the green tendrils climbing up your body.

“Ow!” Petal yells, her beautiful face twisting into a snarl of rage and pain.  “Why… why would you do that?!”

Seeing her upset makes your heart tear in half, fills you with shame.  How could you let this happen?  But… no, you need to be strong.  Otherwise you’re going to end up as just another block of amber.

“Let us… go!” you yell.  “We don’t… want to be here…”

Petal tilts her head in confusion.  

“You don’t?” she asks, directing the question towards Revissa.

Your wife hesitates for a moment.  She looks over her shoulder towards you, then back towards the plant woman, her voice wavering.

“I… I don’t… I don’t want… to… to…” she murmurs.

Petal’s face shifts to one of disappointment, like of a parent scolding a child.

“Of course you do!” she asserts, moving a hand in her direction.  And then the vines snaring Revissa climb higher, stripping away her clothing and pulling her down to her knees.  She tries to call out again, but more tendrils snake across her lips, cutting off her voice, as others twist between her legs, pulling in against her crotch to make her face turn red and her body twitch with helpless pleasure.  “See?  She’s so happy to be here!”

Seeing your wife suffer brings you back to your senses, at least for the moment.  You can’t let things end like this.  You don’t get the sense Petal is full of malice or hatred towards you, but that doesn’t change the fact she intends to keep you here as her prisoners.  You’ve got to stop her!  And the only way to do that is to fight.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="316" name="FC02LB" tags="" position="4725,650" size="100,100">You feel aroused, nearly to the point of mindlessness.  The cloying swirl of pollen and the overwhelming scent of nectar are clouding your mind, sending indescribable pulses of warmth through your body.  And this plant woman is the source of it all.  But despite all that, and despite the fact she has explicitly told you her plan to keep the Knotties - and you - here forever, you don’t necessarily feel any malice in her words.  You get the exact opposite feeling.  There is a kindness to her, a nurturing quality to her voice that makes you think if you could just get her to understand, maybe she would let you go.

“N-no…” you murmur, trying to resist the sensations building up within you.  “This isn’t… not… we don’t…”

The plant woman frowns.  “Is something wrong?” she asks, leaning in close to look you in the eyes.

“We… we want to help, but…”

Her long vine tendrils continue to curl around you, sliding under your clothing, tugging the garments away.

“...but?” she asks sweetly.

You want to say more, but you can’t.  You can’t think straight, can’t form a coherent sentence.  Especially not when those vines tighten and pull you in closer, lifting you up so you’re sharing the interior of her flower with her.  Nectar sloshes around your legs, churning plant matter tugging downwards to pull you in deeper.  Something slips itself between your sex, making you moan in delight, and you feel her hands gently start to massage your heaving breasts.

“See?  Isn’t this nice?” she purrs.  “You’re a good girl.  So just enjoy it.  I’ll take care of everything.”

She leans in, stealing a kiss from your quivering lips, and any sense of composure you had left drains away.  All you can do is close your eyes and surrender yourself completely to her tender ministrations.

[[Give in-&gt;FC02LD]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="317" name="FC02LC" tags="" position="4725,800" size="100,100">It’s no use.  You were already heavily laden with her pollen when you approached.  Now that you’re so close that you can smell her honey-sweet nectar, you’ve lost all sense of composure.  All you can do is look down lamely as one of her vines snakes its way up your body, the tip of it unfurling into a brightly colored flower that sprays a puff of euphoric plant dust right into your face.

Your eyes roll back.  Your lips curl into a smile.  And every ounce of resistance fades from your body.  

“She’s right…” you drawl lazily, taking a step towards your wife.  “She can keep us… as long as she wants…”

“Melfy… no…” Revissa says, backing away weakly.  But that just takes right into Petal’s waiting arms.

The plant woman smiles, dripping some of her nectar into Revissa’s lips, and you watch as your wife finally succumbs as well.  Her shoulders droop, the tension leaves her body, and she smiles warmly towards you, and then to Petal.

“You want… to keep us… forever?” she murmurs, looking up at the beautiful woman above her.

“That’s right!” Petal says, stroking her hair.  “Now, why don’t the two of you get out of those silly clothes, and then we can begin?”

Neither of you can find any reason in the world to say no to her.

[[Give in-&gt;FC02GA]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="318" name="FC02LD" tags="" position="4850,800" size="100,100">You tried your best, but in the end, her allure was too much to handle.  Now all you feel is warmth and pleasure, the indescribable joy of togetherness, the neverending susurrations of pleasure coursing through your unprotesting body.

At some point, Revissa joins you inside the flower bulb.  Had you been self-aware enough to think on it, that might have been a disappointment, since she was your hope for escaping.  Petal keeps the two of you half-submerged inside her plant, with vines digging inside your sexes to maintain a constant churn of stimulation as she takes turns kissing one of you, then the other, back and forth, hungrily and lustilly stoking your emotions to the breaking point.  There is no malice in her movements, not an ounce of wickedness or ill intent, her every action springing from a benevolent, albeit misguided sense of providing the two of you what you want.  She sensed that you came in peace, and so now she will ensure that you come peacefully, over and over, for the rest of your lives.  Escape is impossible, resistance unthinkable, but why would you want to do either?  You’ve never felt better in your life.

And so, slowly, the fronds of her massive flower fold themselves closed, and Petal’s body sinks into the soft soil, taking her two new friends with her as she spreads her roots throughout the forest to search for the place she is most needed.

Petal’s thoughts meld with your own, her memories bind themselves to your consciousness, as yours do to hers.  You can feel her in your mind, probing your thoughts, seeing everything from your life experience up to this point that has made you who you are today.  She doesn’t seem to find it particularly interesting.

Revissa, on the other hand, she understands.  Because your wife has lived a life of championing nature, of trying to protect the trees, the plants, and the animals of the galaxy, of fighting for freedom in the face of adversity.  You can sense the two of them growing closer, of their shared experiences mingling, reinforcing each other, bolstering their sense of togetherness.  But then… it hits a snag.

The memory that confuses Petal is a recent one.  Earlier this very day, the two of you had been trying to push towards the deepest part of the forest to plant the data device when Revissa had been led astray.  The forest had lured her into it, tried to capture her, meld with her, just like Petal is doing now.  But Revissa had fought back against it.  Both of you had.  You were painfully close to being completely overwhelmed, only escaping by the skin of your teeth.  What Petal doesn’t understand is *why* you would want to escape in the first place.  Isn’t being one with the forest your goal?

And so she delves deeper.  This time she actually gives your own memories a second glance, seeing how you’ve loved and laughed, fought and struggled.  She understands what it means to eat and drink, to make friends, to fly through space, to go on adventures, to overcome impossible odds, to see the galaxy, to fall asleep in the arms of your wife, to feel the thrill of victory and the shame of failure.  When you first approached her, you had sensed a lack of malice in Petal, and you were right.  The reason she trapped those Knotties in amber, why she drew you and Revissa into world was out of her own sense of benevolence - she was trying to give to you her own definition of happiness and fulfillment.  All she has ever known is this forest, and all she has ever desired was to see it thrive; the context of her life, the summation of her experiences was so different from yours that it led to a rather sizable misunderstanding, but now she knows more.  And because of it…

Suddenly, you feel the warmth of the sun on your skin.  You look up towards the blue sky, and an apologetic Petal looming over you.  You’re naked and covered in sap, your body exhausted from all the pleasure, but you’re free, and separate from her and from the forest.

“I’m sorry… I didn’t know…” she says, leaning forward with her arms pressed against her bosom.  Nectar still drips from her flower, and that pollen still swirls through the air, so your mind remains trapped in a daze.

Revissa seems a bit more composed.  “It’s alright… you were just doing what you thought was best for the forest.  I’d probably have done the same.”

Petal glances towards the women stuck in amber.  “So… do *they* want to be out too?”

“Probably,” Revissa admits.  “But I suggest you keep them there.  Otherwise they might go back to causing damage again.  I’m sure someone will come along to do something about them… eventually.”

*Way to be the big hero, Revissa*, you think to yourself.  But at least Petal is finally willing to let you go.  The three of you spend some more time chatting, explaining your mission and why you’re here.  And you end with a promise to help protect the forest, and the whole world from greedy opportunists trying to steal the planet’s bounty for themselves.  And Petal promises that she’ll talk to the other plants in the forest to make sure you have free reign to come and go as you please.  

In the end, she wishes you both goodbye, giving you each one last kiss that sends your mind reeling before you manage to pick up your discarded gear and get yourselves dressed.  And then she folds up her fronds and tunnels back into the soil, heading off to some other part of the forest that needs her.

You can sense the two of them growing closer, of their shared experiences mingling, reinforcing each other, bolstering their sense of togetherness.  And once they reach an accord, you become filled with a renewed sense of purpose.  Revissa’s goal becomes your goal, Petal’s solution becomes yours.  What she suggests in this liminal space between interconnected minds is not something you ever would have accepted normally, but here, where consciousness mingles, it seems so patently obvious, that you can’t imagine having ever arrived at any other decision.

Your wife wants to protect nature, and you want to protect your wife.  And so, the two of you should stay here, in the forest, together, protecting it with your bodies and minds, hearts and souls.  And Petal has just the way to achieve that.  

Suddenly you are moving, bodies ferried through some kind of dimensional pocket that Petal uses to travel around the forest, a passage of pure life energy, a leyline of forest spirit.  And then you emerge, gasping for breath, shuddering with pleasure, and for a moment, you see a copse of trees, feel the warmth of sunlight, hear the rustling of branches and song of the birds.  You try to move, to reach towards those brilliant sensations, yet find that you cannot - but any anxiety that might have filled you with that realization vanishes as your body once again quakes with an intense orgasm.  Your eyes open wide, your lips curl back in ecstasy, and your voice pours forth for a few fleeting moments before it is silenced.  For a moment you realize that you are somehow pressed up against a tree - no, melded *with* a tree, half embedded in the bark of its trunk, before that rough wooden surface begins to swirl and flow, passing over you and transforming your body into just another part of nature.

And then it is over, and you and Revissa have reached the end of your journey.  You’re encased in bark, melded with a thick, powerful tree, bodies awash with pleasure, your lower lips parted as thick wooden tendrils jam themselves inside of you, keeping you hopelessly stimulated as your minds go blank with the sensations of joy and togetherness.  

Now you’re a literal part of the forest, your never-ending orgasms used as a spiritual food source to keep the land around you fresh, healthy, and well-nurtured.  This is the solution Petal came up with, the one you both accepted while your minds were linked.  If there was some part of you still capable of intelligent thought, you might have objected, but now there is only the endless pleasure, the intense churn of orgasmic bliss that comes from a job well done.

As you step away from the central clearing, however, Revissa tilts her head to the side curiously, seemingly noticing something different about the energy of the forest around you.

“I think… that Petal was some kind of… hub, I guess you could call it.  She connected with the plants in the nearby area, gave them an intelligence and willpower that they would have otherwise lacked.”

You nod your head, remembering how she was able to conjure up vines that seemed unrelated to her own main body.  Maybe now that she’s reached an understanding with you, you’ll have an easier time moving through the forest.  Not to mention she might be able to help you out if you’re in danger later, which will certainly be possible as you continue on with your mission.  Though before that, you have something else you need to do. (if: $rosawake is true)[Namely, you need to let Ros’eela know what happened.  You left her behind at the cargo ship, where she was going to contact her people at the main camp to inform them of the incident that had occurred here.  So you head up the loading ramp and past the security drones to find her in the captain’s quarters.

Enough time passed during the encounter with Petal that it should be safe to thaw Ros’eela out from her metal prison, should you so desire.

Though… it’s not like you *have* to unfreeze her just yet.  If you do, she would probably report what happened to the main encampment, which would take away a potential trump card that could be used in future negotiations.  Maybe you could keep her on ice at least until you’re done with what you need to do on the planet.  Surely she’d understand; freezium is a part of Knottie culture after all, though to a lesser degree than bondage.  Besides… she’d look rather fetching on the wall of your quarters…

You’ll never know what happened to the rest of your crew.  Perhaps they searched for you after you lost contact, but could never find you – after all, they never would think to look for you embedded on the side of a tree.  Or perhaps they, too, fell prey to some peril of the planet, becoming trapped and forced to wait for a rescue from *you*.  Though that, of course, is a rescue that will never come.

But none of that really matters to you now, and to be honest, you barely spare your friends a single thought.  There’s just no room in your mind for it amidst all the euphoric eruptions of pleasure.

It’s several days after you were first transformed that they manage to locate you, and several weeks beyond that before Vhaja and Jyumon are able to work out the specifics of the unusual transformation, and devise the sigils for a recovery spell that Lumina manages to properly incant.  But even after you and Revissa are freed from your barky prisons and returned to the ship, it will take months of recovery time and mental reconditioning to fully separate your minds from the endless pleasure of the forest.

It won’t be until a year later that you are finally ready to go adventuring again - though obviously, you’ve failed this particular mission.  And from then on, you and Revissa both will always find yourselves getting rather hot and bothered whenever you look at a particularly sturdy tree.

Though you might have worked up the willpower to resist her control for the moment, any minute that might change.  Maybe in a protracted fight you’d be able to wear Petal down with your sword, but when the clock is ticking you know that you’re going to need Revissa to use her magic to turn the tides in your favor.

And so, you make the executive decision to run towards your lovely wife and try to cut her bonds.  It’s a good plan – but it doesn’t work.

Because as it turns out, you underestimated Petal, and the extent of her control over this forest and the soil it rests on.  You thought if you just kept an eye on the vines extending from her main body, you’d be safe, that she had a range limit for how far they could twist through the earth beneath you.  But you were wrong.  With a twitch of her hand, she summons a totally unrelated flower to spring forth from the ground at your feet, commanding it to snare you with even more leafy ropes.

In an instant, the tendrils are around you, snatching your sword and throwing it uselessly to the side.  More catch your legs, holding you in place, as verdant fronds start to close around you, filling the air with the cloying scent of pollen.  You feel your clothes get shorn away, and then your lips get wrapped up tight, as more start to go for your arms, hoping to cut off the last bit of mobility you have left.

Maybe, in an ideal situation, you’d still have been strong enough to fight them off.  But you’re already so damned horny.  And so, when one of those naughty tentacles slips itself between the gap in your legs, plunging deep into your sex, you yelp in surprise and arousal, losing the fight to keep the vines from wrapping around your arms.  They encircle your wrists, pulling your protesting limbs behind your back and holding them tight, pulling you off your feet and down into the plant’s waiting maw.

The last thing you see before the petals snap closed is Petal’s smiling face, and Revissa&#39;s body being encircled by her own hungry plant.  And then there’s only darkness as you are fully consumed.  For a moment you writhe there, helpless and horny, unable to resist as the plant’s tendrils probe inside your lower lips with lusty abandon.  But then you are pushed over the edge, and together with your rumbling climax you feel the petals holding you begin to move, burrowing deep underground and taking your captive body with them.

Based on your observations, it looks like Petal is both the gorgeous woman and the flower her body is extending out of.  And though it pains you to hurt her, you think that if you manage to cut the stem out from beneath the flower, you may be able to sever her connection to the earth and ground.  Considering how quickly she caught Revissa with subterranean vines, you know that in an extended fight, she’ll just catch you too.  So the best time to act is now, when she might not realize the threat that you pose to her.

So you charge towards her, taking a zig-zag pattern to hopefully confound any attempts to snare you with more leafy tendrils.  And sure enough, several do spring up from the ground as you run, trying to snag your arms or legs but coming up with only air as you deftly dodge away from their grip.  Yes - this can work!  You manage to close the distance between the two of you, doing your best not to look Petal in the eyes, since you’re sure the expression she makes when her flower is sliced will hurt you as much as it hurts her.  And then with a deep breath and a steeling battle cry you swing your blade with all the force you can muster, striking the stem of her flower strong and true.

*Thunk.*

Your blade finds home, embedding itself into the sturdy stem of plant flesh, doing a bit of damage… but not nearly enough to cleave itself all the way through.

“Owwww!” screeches Petal, voice filled with pain and regret.  “Why… *why* would you do that?!

Realizing you’re going to need another swing to finish severing the stem, you try to pull your sword away, but find that it is firmly stuck.  You get two solid tugs at it before you’re given no more, and powerful loops of vines wrap around your body and pull you away.

“You people… all you people are *just the worst*!” Petal yells, tears forming in her eyes.  “First you come and cut down trees and hurt the animals… and now this?  I thought if I was nice and gave them a home here, they would stop causing so much trouble, but I guess you’re never going to stop, are you?”

You try to pull free, but she’s angry now, and her vines prove to be much stronger than you are.  They wrap around you, pull away your clothing, extract your sword from her stem and toss it away into the woods, never to be seen again.

“How many more of you annoying… *pests* are there?” she asks.

“I… I don’t…” you start to say, but she’s having none of it.

“Tell me!” she demands, twisting you upside down then dunking your face into the nectar pooling up around her thighs.  And then she pulls you in close, cupping your face and bringing it in for a sap-filled kiss.  “Tell me,” she says again, softer, cloyingly.

The nectar is so sweet, so wonderful, it washes away any fear or doubts.  Of course you’ll tell her.  After all… she asked you so nicely.  And it’s only fair after what you’ve done to her.

“We came… on a starship.  There were… six of us.  You already have… me and Revissa…”

“And the others?” Petal asks.  “Can you call them?  Bring them here?”

You nod, glancing towards your comm device which was pulled from your arm when she stripped you.  A vine snatches it up and brings it close to your face.

“Then call them.  Get them all in one place.  And then we’ll end this infestation once and for all!”

Though it’s obviously meant to contain humanoids, there’s no reason that it shouldn’t work on plants - especially a plant as shapely as this one.  If you could aim it properly, it shouldn’t be too hard to cause the gas to erupt and encase Petal in quickly hardening metal, eliminating her as a threat for the time being.

But there’s the problem - if you miss, you’re in deep trouble, because you doubt she’ll give you a second chance.  Which means that the important thing is to wait for an opening.  Petal continues to smile at you in that enchanting way of hers, beckoning you to come closer.  She’s not making any aggressive moves at the moment, but she’s not going to wait forever, so you’d better pick something quickly.

Previously, you might have tried to fight against it, but now you know that this is where you belong, this is what you want.

If there is one downside to your new arrangement, it’s that Revissa is not here with you.  And yet, you can somehow still sense her.

With everything here made of Ghost Matter, you never grow hungry, never want for nourishment or fear the ravages of time.  In here, buried in the soil, you are eternal.  Nothing ever comes for you, no one ever tries to dig you up.  Vaguely you recall a life on a starship, a crew full of friends, but if they are still on the planet, you don’t ever see them.  Maybe they left.  Or maybe some other peril on the planet took them.  You don’t know, nor does it seem all that important to you now.

What does matter is keeping yourself stimulated, since your pleasure serves as some kind of psychic nutrient that feeds and sustains the forest around you.  Luckily, that won’t be a problem.  Though every day from now on will be exactly the same, at the same time, it will also always be a climax.

As it turns out, your crew was able to track you down thanks to the Star Scout homing beacon you swallowed at the start of the adventure.  And though it took several months for them to return to the planet with the excavation equipment needed to dig you out from the soil, when they did, they found that you and Revissa were enclosed in flowers side by side, a few scant feet apart from one another.  She was extracted first, but you came soon after, and once you were secured they quickly dragged you to your ship and flew away.

What will follow is several long months of recovery as you learn how to exist as a single entity and not a part of the forest, but eventually you’ll be back on your feet again and ready to go on more adventures.  Though hopefully, they will go better than this one, which was rather decisively a complete failure.

“Well then where the hell is she?” Krysta grumbles, looking around.  “After dragging us all the way out here, the least she could do is wait somewhere that we can see her.”

“I swear… if I came all this way and got covered in sweat for nothing…” says Jyumon, happy to bring up the rear in the search party.

Lumina unfurls her wings.  “Do you think she might be hurt?  She sounded strange in the message she left us.”  With a flap, she takes to the air… and then she spies you, sitting naked in the middle of an open field, cross-legged, with a placid smile on your face.

“This way…” you say lazily, mind still trapped in a daze.  By now your nose has grown accustomed to the scent of pollen, but it’s still here, flowing in the air, turning your mind to mush and binding your willpower to the flower-woman that produced it.

Though Petal, sadly, is nowhere to be found.  She had no desire to come into close contact with any more ‘parasites,’ as she now refers to you and any other humanoid that intrudes in her forest.  But the trap she’s set should be more than enough to handle your crew.

“Melfy?  Are you… okay?”  Lumina flutters down, putting a hand onto your forehead with a frown.  “You’ve got a fever.  What happened?  And where is Revissa?”

Your wife, you are well aware, is strung up in a nearby tree, mummified in vines and writhing helplessly as she is subjected to orgasm after orgasm.  You can’t wait to rejoin her.  But first you need to make sure the pests are taken care of.  And yet… some part of you still knows that is wrong.

“I… we… you need… to… get away…” you manage to murmur.  “It’s… a… a…”

But then you trail off, unable to effectively communicate your warning.  Lumina catches on to the situation though, raising her staff as it thrums with celestial energy.  

“Your mind is clouded,” she says with a frown.  “Hold on…”

The spell washes over you and has the intended effect.  All at once the grip of the pollen lessens, allowing you to open your eyes wide and jump to your feet.

“Everyone, get out of here!” you yell.  “It’s a trap!”

Jyumon sighs.  “I figured as much,” she says, her bushy tail flicking as her hands finish tracing the somatic motions for a fireball spell in the air.  “Which is why I came prepared with my favorite gardening tool.  No way I’m going to — accckkkmmmmpphhh!”

Despite her confidence, she hadn’t expected the vines to spring up so quickly.  In an instant her clothes are shredded, her limbs restrained, and her lips sealed, preventing her from finishing the spell she had so sagely prepared.  With a tug she is pulled to the ground, bound, gagged, and helpless.  But she’s about to have company.

“They’re coming from the ground!” Vhaja yells, quickly swishing her fingers to imbue herself with a spell of levitation.  Her feet shoot up from the ground, body bobbing in the air maybe five feet from the forest floor.  Lumina gets the message and makes herself airborne as well, the two of them preparing magic that will help them overcome the trials facing them.  But the vines aren’t limited to terrestrial targets.  They emerge from the soil and spring up much farther than the pair could have predicted, swiftly wrapping round their bodies and divesting them of their clothing.

It’s at this point that the culprit of the assault makes itself known.   A massive, brilliantly colored flower emerges from the soil at your feet, its leaves spreading outwards to reveal even more of the dextrous tendrils it had used to snare its prey.  You’re caught immediately, tight green ropes wrapping around your already naked form, though Krysta tries to make an acrobatic leap backwards to avoid capture.  It doesn’t work.  The plant manages to catch her by the wrists, binding her arms together and dragging her to the forest floor, swiftly shredding her clothing and pulling her backwards towards its waiting maw.  She tries to claw the earth with her bare feet to slow it down, but it makes a negligible difference as your crew is all brought into its fold.]

For a few seconds, you put up a token resistance, trying to pull the powerful vines away from your body, but a fragrant puff of pollen from the plant’s center quickly undoes whatever benefit Lumina’s healing spell had given you.  Your arms go slack as your mind drifts off, the vines tightening ever more firmly to make sure you’re unable to resist.  Jyumon’s restrained body is soon dragged over to join you, as well as Revissa, who was bundled up tightly in the trees out of sight.  

You look helplessly between the squirming bodies of your crew, hoping at least one of them will find some way to escape the plant’s grip before it’s too late, but alas, the opportunity for salvation is painfully fleeting, gone within a few minutes.  Because as more and more of that pollen spills out, your friends’ struggles grow weaker and weaker, until not a single one of you is spared the drugged stupor of compliance that these nefarious plants can wreak.  

Petal had called you and your friends parasites, said you were invasive pests.  Whether she was justified with that insult is up for debate, but what is not in question is the fact that she knew just the pesticide to take care of you.  Because soon all six of you are fully consumed by pleasure, bound up in vines that don’t leave even an ounce of mobility.  And once it is sure you’re all properly packaged, the plant pulls your bodies in close, smushing warm flesh against each other so you all become a single writhing, moaning, orgasming mass of churning bodies.  Dextrous vines snake themselves between slick thighs, pressing themselves into awaiting sexes to bring you all into a simultaneous climax that seems to stretch on for hours.

And then, finally, the flower’s petals close in over the six of you, shielding you from the light, forming a snug cocoon over your impotently squirming figures.  Its roots extend downwards, dragging itself, and the six of you, deep underground, where the tantric waves of euphoria you all release will serve as spiritual fertilizer for the forest for many generations to come.

After some complicated excavation, she managed to dig you all up and free you from the confines of the lust-inducing plant.  

Of course, it’s been so long that the galaxy has changed immensely since you were all first caught, meaning everyone is going to have to start new lives in a world mostly unfamiliar to you.  It’s the start of a brand new adventure… though you’re only beginning it because you failed at your old one.

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="332" name="FC02MCA" tags="" position="5150,1125" size="100,100">You shake your head and slap your cheeks, trying to snap yourself out of it.  There’s no way you’d be stupid enough to get closer - her pollen would sap away your resolve immediately!  Instead, you’re just going to have to take the risk of tossing the canister from here.

“Is something wrong?” Petal says sweetly.  Beside her, the vines wrapped around Revissa tighten, causing your wife to mewl helplessly with pleasure.  

Well, it’s now or never.  Gripping the canister firmly, you wind your arm back and then toss it with all your might, sending the grenade-like projectile careening towards the curvaceous plant woman.  But then your heart skips a beat as you watch it veer off its path.  Being an oddly shaped object, it does not move in exactly the direction you thought it was going to, spinning at a weird angle that will take it past her shoulders instead of right at her feet.  However, luck is on your side, as instead of letting it sail past her, Petal snaps a vine into the air, catching the canister with enough force to cause it to shatter into pieces right above her, sending a misty wave of vapor right down onto her body.

She shrieks in surprise, and you can see her start to stiffen, freezium gas clinging to her frame and swiftly calcifying into a metal shell.  But… it’s not quite enough.  Normally freezium is dispersed in a small chamber to make sure the gas circulates evenly, so that several layers of icy molecules cling to the subject and trap them in an impermeable shell.  But when it’s airborne like this, there’s a lot of waste product that doesn’t attach itself to her, especially when she’s flailing and struggling to break free.  You can hear the metal snapping and crackling –meaning she’ll only be trapped for a few seconds at most.  

Sadly, the battle is far from over, so you’ll have to come up with something else if you want to emerge victorious.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="333" name="FC02MCB" tags="" position="5275,1000" size="100,100">It’s dangerous to risk a long-distance throw.  If you miss, you’ll be out of weapons.  Better to get up closer first, to make sure it connects.  

And so, you begin to walk forward, pretending you’ve fully fallen under the spell of her enchanting pollen.  One step, and then another, you advance slowly but with determination, not breaking eye contact with the woman for even a moment.  You tell yourself it’s because you want to read her expression in case she decides to attack, but honestly, it’s because she’s just so damn beautiful.  The curl of her lips, the fluffiness of her leafy hair, the swell of her bosom, and, yes, that amazing smell.  You can’t help but take a deep whiff of the pollen as you draw near, feeling its warmth spread through you.  It’s such a calming scent, making your worries melt away as you finally arrive at the foot of her bulbous plant.

“What’s that in your hand?” she asks sweetly, tilting her head to examine the canister.

“Oh… this?” you murmur.

…wait, what was it again?  Oh, right.  You were supposed to throw it!  But… why would you want to throw it?  It’s hard to remember with your mind in such a dreamy fog.

“It’s… erm.  It’s called… freezium.  It… freezes things,” you explain.

“Freezes?” Petal says with a frown.  “I don’t much like the cold.”

“Right, sorry,” you say, stowing the canister back in your pack.  You wouldn’t want to upset Petal.  She’s just so lovely!  Though, distantly, your mind warns you about something.  Wasn’t… wasn’t this freezium important for some reason?  You were… right, you were supposed to throw it at someone!  But… who?  Petal says she doesn’t like the cold.  So it couldn’t have been for her.

“What were you going to freeze?” she asks, as one of her vines curls around your shoulder.  You see the tip of it is slick with that amber nectar of hers, its scent even more divine than the pollen.

“I… erm… I can’t…”  It’s so hard to think!  You were going to use this canister on someone… because someone needed to be frozen.  But… if it wasn’t Petal… then the only other person it could possibly be for is… yourself?  “It’s… for me?”

“For you?” Petal asks warmly.  “But surely not just you.  For her, too, right?”

She glances down at Revissa, still restrained by her vines.  Yes, that makes sense, you think.  The two of you were going to be frozen.  That’s the only explanation that makes sense.  Vaguely you feel some alarm bells going off in the back of your head about an alternative reason, but you quickly push them down.  And meanwhile, Petal helpfully uses her tendrils to peel away your clothing, leaving you naked and in a compliant daze in front of her.

“Well?  Go ahead, get frozen,” she says with a welcoming smile.

Completely under her spell, you just nod.  “It’s… better to do it with the machine…” you murmur, taking Revissa by the hand.  Petal releases her from the grip of the plants, allowing her to go with you.  “But… I’ll see if we can’t have a drone deliver us to you when you’re finished…”

Petal claps her hands.  “That sounds lovely!” she says, using a vine to push the two of you in the direction of the freezing chamber.

What happens next is a blur.  You walk and open a door.  You press some buttons and hear a whoosh.  You input some commands to some droids, then you step into a small, cramped chamber together with Revissa.  The two of you wrap your arms around each other and then relax, as you hear the rush of air and feel an intense cold on your skin.  And then… you feel and see nothing at all.

A few minutes later, Petal looks up as some security drones arrive, using hover-beams to slide a thick slab of metal down in front of her.

“Wow… so that’s what it’s like to be frozen,” she says, feeling the contours of the metal casing with her vines.  “It’s not for me… but it’s a good look for you two!”

You and Revissa, of course, have no response.  And you won’t have one for a long, long time.  Petal spends some time appreciating you, as well as Ros’eela and the other Knottie, which the same droids were kind enough to carry over to her as well.  But in the end, she has places to go and forests to protect, so she leaves you there on the ground, a curious novelty that is soon forgotten entirely.  And then all there is left to do is wait.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="334" name="FC02MD" tags="" position="5275,1125" size="100,100">A thought occurs to you.  Throwing the freezium from far away risks missing, but getting too close puts you in range of her pollen.  But what if there was a way to incapacitate her for a short while that had a higher chance of success?

In addition to the canister of freezium, you also have a perfectly sealed sphere of alien goop, which you are sure will break out of its shell at the slightest impact.  And if that impact were to occur next to a certain sultry plant woman, well, then that would make her be most likely target for its slimy assault.  

You flash what you hope is a disarming smile towards Petal as you fish through your pack for the frozen slim.  

“Wow… you’re so pretty,” you say, as your fingers clasp around the sphere.  “I really wanna get to know you better.  Do you mind if we play a game?”

“A game?” Petal says, with equal parts interest and caution.  She can clearly tell that you’re not fully under her spell just yet, but at the same time, she seems intensely curious about you.  “What kind of game?”

“Oh, it’s a very simple thing.  Children play it all the time.”  You palm the frozen orb and shift your posture to a pitcher’s stance.  “It’s called… *catch!*”

And then the ball flies from your hand.  Petal moves quickly - more quickly than you had expected - shifting the positioning of her vines to intercept the projectile before it strikes her.  But that only shatters the frozen coating around the rubbery symbiote and frees it from its icy slumber, immediately causing it to awaken and wrap itself around her body.

“W-what is this?!” she shrieks.  “I don’t think I like this game — hrmmph!”

You watch as it attaches itself to her face, forming a rubbery sheathe over her lips, and completely occupying her attention.  Now’s the time to strike!

Running forward, you pull out the freezium canister, getting close enough that you’re sure it won’t miss.  And with a toss, it falls and shatters at the base of her giant flower, forming a cloud of metallic mist that envelops her from top to bottom.  The gooey symbiote reacts immediately, pulling itself away from Petal’s body as it is once more subjected to sub-zero temperatures, but with its structural integrity already compromised from the previous freezing it instead completely flakes apart into nothing.  This just leaves Petal, who swivels her hips to look towards you, a feeling of betrayal evident in her eyes, before the mist fully hardens around her.

And then she’s a statue.  The leaves covering her generous bosom harden and crack away, and all that fragrant nectar pooled up in her lap dissolves.  No more enchanting pollen spreads from her leaves, and no more vines curl up from the ground to protect her.  She’s been completely defeated.

You fall to the ground in relief, finally able to think clearly.  And beside you, you see the tendrils that had been binding up Revissa go slack, letting her pull herself free and slump down at your side.

For a while, you both just lay there, but eventually you wrap your arms around each other and work off the arousal that had been building up since you first set eyes on the gorgeous plant woman.  When you’re finished, you put your clothes back on and return to the outpost, leaving the inert plant sculpture behind.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="335" name="FC02MCC" tags="" position="5150,1250" size="100,100">You’re not going to get another chance if you want to defeat her.  And so you decide to take the initiative and rush towards her, sword drawn.  The freezium metal will only be keeping her in check for a few moments, but you’ve turned the tides of a battle in less time than that.  

Based on your observations, it looks like Petal is both the gorgeous woman and the flower her body is extending out of.  And though it pains you to hurt her, you think that if you manage to cut the stem out from beneath the flower, you may be able to sever her connection to the earth and ground.  Considering how quickly she caught Revissa with subterranean vines, you know that in an extended fight, she’ll just catch you too.  So the best time to act is now, while she’s still incapacitated.  With a deep breath and a steeling battle cry you swing your blade with all the force you can muster, striking the stem of her flower strong and true.

*Thunk.*

Your blade finds home, embedding itself into the sturdy stem of plant flesh, doing a bit of damage… but not nearly enough to cleave itself all the way through.  It was foolish to think that you could defeat her with a single blow.  And even worse, the ringing impact from your sword strike seems to have accelerated the process of her cracking out of the freezium shell.  You see it flake off, bits of metal dropping to the ground, revealing the gorgeous woman beneath it … as well as the snarl of rage on her face over the wound you had inflicted on her.

“Owwww!” screeches Petal, voice filled with pain and regret.  “Why… *why* would you do that?!

Realizing you’re going to need another swing to finish severing the stem, you try to pull your sword away, but find that it is firmly stuck.  You get two solid tugs at it before you’re given no more, and powerful loops of vines wrap around your body and pull you away.

“You people… all you people are *just the worst*!” Petal yells, tears forming in her eyes.  “First they come and cut down trees and hurt the animals… and now this?  I thought if I was nice and gave them a home here, they would stop causing so much trouble, but I guess you’re *neve*r going to stop, are you?”

You try to pull free, but she’s angry now, and her vines prove to be much stronger than you are.  They wrap around you, pull away your clothing, extract your sword from her stem and toss it away into the woods, never to be seen again.

“How many more of you annoying… *pests* are there?” she demands.

“I… I don’t…” you start to say, but she’s having none of it.

“Tell me!” she demands, twisting you upside down then dunking your face into the nectar pooling up around her thighs.  And then she pulls you in close, cupping your face and bringing it in for a sap-filled kiss.  “Tell me,” she says again, softer, cloyingly.

The nectar is so sweet, so wonderful, it washes away any fear or doubts.  Of course you’ll tell her.  After all… she asked you so nicely.  And it’s only fair after what you’ve done to her.

“We came… on a starship.  There were… six of us.  You already have… me and Revissa…”

“And the others?” Petal asks.  “Can you call them?  Bring them here?”

You nod, glancing towards your comm device which was pulled from your arm when she stripped you.  A vine snatches it up and brings it close to your face.

“Then call them.  Get them all in one place.  And then we’ll end this infestation once and for all!”

The freezium bought you a chance to prove discretion is the better part of valor, and you’d be a fool not to take it.  So instead of rushing at the plant woman, you instead attack the vines she had used to snare your wife, severing the leafy tendrils with a few well-placed sword slashes.  Once Revissa is free, you quickly take her by the hand and pull her away, fleeing the clearing where the beguiling plant woman has made her home.

Though as you leave, you can’t help but remember Ros’eela.  You’d left her mounted on the wall of one of the buildings in the living quarters.  The right thing to do would be to go back and thaw her out… though the more time you waste here, the more opportunity Petal will have to catch you.

As you walk, Revissa closes her eyes for a moment, sensing some kind of change in the texture of the forest around you.

“I think… that Petal was some kind of… hub, I guess you could call it.  She connected with the plants in the nearby area, gave them an intelligence and willpower that they would have otherwise lacked.”

You nod your head, remembering how she was able to conjure up vines that seemed unrelated to her own main body.  Maybe now that she’s been rendered inert, you’ll have an easier time moving through the forest.  Though before that, you have something else you need to do.  Heading back to the buildings of the living quarters, you locate the room with the freezium chamber, finding Ros’eela and the other Knottie right where you left them, mounted on the wall.  Enough time passed during the encounter with Petal that it should be safe to thaw Ros’eela out from her metal prison, should you so desire.

Though… it’s not like you *have* to unfreeze her just yet.  If you do, she would probably report what happened to the main encampment, which would take away a potential trump card that could be used in future negotiations.  Maybe you could keep her on ice at least until you’re done with what you need to do on the planet.  Surely she’d understand; freezium is a part of Knottie culture after all, though to a lesser degree than bondage.  Besides… she’d look rather fetching on the wall of your quarters…

You go over with her in detail about your encounter with Petal.  After what happened, Revissa feels like there should be no further threats to the camp, ensuring that Ros’eela and the rest of her people are free to restore the amber-encased workers at their leisure.  Ros’eela expresses her thanks, and promises to help you out however she can in the future, should you need it.

You’d like to tell yourself that if you didn’t trust her already, you’d have been able to fight her off.  But… that’s probably not accurate.  Her mastery of bondage martial arts is unparalleled, and before you know you and your wife have been trussed up in ropes and placed entirely at her mercy.  She has the gall to call it a ‘simple tie’, as she rigs up some kind of pulley system to suspend the two of you from the ceiling, looking you over with satisfaction as you wriggle and squirm against the taut restraints.  Simple or not, you’re pretty sure you wouldn’t be able to escape at all, even if you had days to work at it.

Luckily, Ros’eela only wants you for an hour or two.  She puts those head tendrils of hers to good work, pressing her face between your writhing bodies and inserting the tips of them past the crotch ropes and into the slits between your legs, massaging you both to a warm and wet orgasm while you moan into your gags.  Then she ties *herself* up, forcing herself into a kneeling position and locking those tendrils in place, squirming together with the two of you as she pushes you over the edge for round two.

Unlike you, she has no problem escaping from the binds she applied, so after she’s had her fun she unties herself then unhooks you from the ceiling, instead flopping you down onto the bed (thankfully without triggering the vacuum sealing feature on it). Then she ties herself up again and nuzzles in between you, letting you all take a refreshing bondage nap together.  After an hour she finally decides she is done repaying you, undoing your bonds and allowing you to take a quick shower and get dressed.  Despite the unusual nature of the rest, you have to admit it does leave you feeling recharged.  She gives you each one final affectionate kiss before sending you on your way back into the forest, opting to stay behind to finish up the work that needs doing at the outpost.

So with all of that taken care of, you feel you are now ready to continue on with your original mission.  Revissa was pretty confident that there would be no more threats from the local flora, meaning it should be a straight shot to the deepest part of the forest where you need to set up the data collection device.  Though of course it’s always possible Revissa made a mistake.  If you’re not feeling confident about your chances, you could always double back and try a different route through the forest.

“It would just be until we leave the planet,” you promise.

That’s not good at all.  Her prediction immediately comes true as a thick tree root suddenly bursts out of the ground to try and trip you up, followed by a heavy branch swinging across the path in front of you.  But you’re fast enough to push past them, emerging back at the riverbank where you first spotted the tree with the faucet on it.  That same tree starts to erupt, spilling glossy sap on the forest floor, forcing you to dodge to the side lest you get coated in quick-drying amber.

Eventually, you reach the point where you need to branch off from the river, and to your relief, the only thing in your way is a large, open, grassy patch of land, no trees, flowers, or bushes in sight - there’s not even any large rocks or other obstructions for a predator to hide behind.  In such a wide, clear area, you feel like there’s no chance of getting taken by surprise.  Though as you walk over it, Revissa pauses for a moment, frowning, before she kneels down and brushes her fingers through the blades of grass.

“The grass… does not appreciate being walked on,” she says slowly.  “It’s quite angry with us.”

You raise an eyebrow.  Trees and flowers, sure, you can see them having some degree of emotions, but *grass*?  Though you can tell Revissa is serious.  So with a sigh, you abandon the safety of the wide-open field and double back to the treeline, keeping to the rough, root-strewn patches of soil beneath the shade of the branches.  You feel rather silly about it, but luckily there’s nothing lurking in the shadows of the overhead boughs, and so you eventually advance to the center of the forest with only a slight delay thanks to the detour.

Revissa listens as you express your fears, and eventually agrees to double back with you.  “If I had to guess, it’s the proximity to the river that has made the plants in this particular stretch so exceedingly active” she muses, sparing a glance towards the water as you make your retreat.  “So the farther away from it we get, the less likely we’ll meet anyone else like Petal.”

That makes sense to you.  Though even if you avoid any horny plants, that doesn’t mean there won’t be some other dangers awaiting you.  Hopefully you’ll have what it takes to escape those ones, too.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="344" name="FC02NG" tags="" position="4450,1550" size="100,100">There’s no time to waste - every minute you remain here is another opportunity for one of these plants to catch you!  And so, as you approach the river, you decide your best bet is to grab Revissa by the hand and leap together with her into the water.  As soon as you breach the surface, you feel the pull of the current take hold of you, carrying you backwards through the forest back towards the entrance.

Even here in the water, you can see various plants bordering the river trying to turn against you, springing up from the riverbed or springing downwards from overhanging branches.  But you manage to evade them, in no small part thanks to Revissa’s nature magic, keeping the aggressive flora at bay until you have put considerable distance between yourselves and the Knottie outpost.  Eventually you feel you have gone far enough and pull yourselves out of the water, finding on your map that you’re a short distance away from where you started.

“Hmm…” Revissa says, closing her eyes and feeling the pulse of nature around her.  “I think Petal’s range is limited.  We’ve gone far enough away from her that I don’t think we’ll be in any more danger from her influence.”

Well, that’s a relief.  Though it also means that, for all your efforts, you’re right back at square one.  It looks like you’ve got no choice but to find another path through the forest if you want to complete your mission.

[[Head back to the start-&gt;FA06]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="345" name="FC04B" tags="" position="2350,175" size="100,100">You briefly consider jumping into the river, but think better of it, knowing that there’s just as many plants near the water than there are away from it.  Better to stay on land where your strength and mobility are at their best.  And so the two of you make your escape, charging back along the side of the stream as branches swing down to block your way, and random creeper vines attempt to snag your ankles.

But you fight through them.  Between your swordplay and Revissa’s nature magic, they aren’t able to hold you down, and eventually you feel that you’ve gotten far enough away that you’re in the clear.  Revissa warns you to still be wary, of course, but for now you stop running and slow your pace, finally allowing yourself to breathe normally again.  It’s still a bit of a walk to return to the entrance, so you’d best get moving.

Unfortunately, it is at the exact moment that you first let your guard down that you feel the rumble of movement from beneath the soil, followed by the eruption of several hidden creeper vines that dart upwards and wrap themselves around your limbs.

[[Get tangled-&gt;FC04D]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="346" name="FC03DC" tags="" position="2375,475" size="100,100">Eventually, you reach the point where you need to branch off from the river, and to your relief, the only thing in your way is a large, open, grassy patch of land with no trees, flowers, or bushes in sight - there’s not even any large rocks or other obstructions for a predator to hide behind.  In such a wide, clear area, you feel like there’s no chance of getting taken by surprise.

In retrospect, you should have foreseen the problem.  Together, you and Revissa begin marching across the open plain, eyes darting warily back and forth - towards the distant trees, towards the river behind you, towards the sky above - everywhere but down at your feet.  If you had looked that way, you might have noticed the ominous way the blades of grass shifted as you walked over them, swaying not in sync with the direction of the wind but their own internal chemistry.  How every strand bent towards the intruders in their territory, how the two of you were not welcome, even here, in an open, unassuming stretch of land.

The grass waits until the two of you are far into the center of the patch of green, when you stop for a moment to pull off your boot to shake out a pebble that had gotten stuck.  It is the very moment that the rock strikes the ground that the grass begins to sway, suddenly growing in length and spooling outwards with a mind all its own.  In an instant your legs have been wrenched together, throwing you off balance and making you drop your boot onto the ground.  More blades of grass twirl upwards to ensnare and destroy the foreign object, turning it into tiny scraps that are swiftly buried beneath the soil.  As if the grass wants to cover up any trace of your existence.

Beside you, Revissa shrieks in surprise as she, too, is targeted, her staff yanked from her hand and dropped with a soft thunk onto the soft green surface beneath her.  Your instinct is to reach out towards her, but the growing coils of flora capture your arm and pull it against your body, shredding any clothing it catches along the way.  Now realizing the peril the two of you are in, your wife tries to close her eyes and use her magic to connect with the grass attempting to entrap you, but all she senses is a terrifying, violent impulse to subjugate all that does not belong.  She comes out of her trance with a gasp, just as the grass curls past her chin and over her mouth to seal away her voice.

With only a moment before you, too, are fully restrained, you recall the freezium gas capsule you had liberated from the chamber back at the outpost.  You manage to pull it out of your bag at the last possible moment with your one free arm, just as the grass snags your wrist.  The capsule drops to the ground, but you manage to catch the edge of it with your teeth and yank open the release valve, causing super-chilled metallic gas to spray outwards all around you.  Propelled by the expelled vapor, the capsule shoots around randomly, icing over the thin fibers of grass and causing it to shatter away, but never expelling enough over you or Revissa’s body to fully encase you.  This gives you the opportunity you need to escape the grip of the plants, scooping up your wife and making a run for the trees as flakes of hardened metal crackle away from your body.

The grass is not done trying to catch you, but now that you’re expecting it you manage to wrench it off of your ankles before it wraps you up, and then with one final leap you dive beneath the cover of the trees, outside of the range  the probing tendrils can reach.  You and Revissa lay there panting for a good while, looking fearfully towards what had seemed to just be an unassuming patch of greenery.

“I think… this particular field of grass very much does not like to be stepped on,” Revissa murmurs after a moment. 

“Maybe ask it to put up a ‘keep off the grass sign’ next time?” you suggest, getting just a roll of her eyes in response.

Your clothing and weapons were all destroyed by the attack, but luckily you managed to hold on to your satchel containing the data device for the mission, as well as the synthesizer capsules Jyumon provided you to create duplicates of your outfits.  So after a few minutes the two of you are dressed up again and ready to continue towards the heart of the forest – though this time you make sure to avoid any patches of grass along the way.

Let it be somebody else’s problem, you figure.]

Once you get far enough away from the camp, the cloying scent of sweet pollen finally fades away, allowing you to think clearly once again.  It was starting to get hard to concentrate.  Regardless, you double back to the edge of the path leading to the outpost, finding yourself once more at the side of the river.  And now you turn back the way you came, returning to the entrance of the forest to hopefully find a safer path to the heart of the woods.

Unfortunately, it turns out that in the end, nothing in this part of the forest is truly safe.  For no sooner do you let your mind wander and glance towards the readout on your holo-map than you feel the rumble of movement from beneath the soil, followed by the eruption of several hidden creeper vines that dart upwards and wrap themselves around your limbs.

[[Get tangled-&gt;FC04D]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="348" name="FC04D" tags="" position="2100,175" size="100,100">You grunt in surprise as the vines wrap around your legs, pulling themselves taut to anchor you to the spot.

“Grah!  I’ve had enough of these damn plants!” you yell, trying to reach for your sword.  But they seem to have predicted that, as several more green tendrils emerge from a tree branch above you, snagging your wrist before you can get a grip on the weapon.

“It’s like… they don’t want to let us leave,” Revissa says nervously, clutching her staff firmly as she tries to connect with the natural world around you.  “They… they see us as a source of nourishment.  They want our life energy to… to fertilize the forest!”

“Well tell them my energy is reserved for other things!” you yell, tugging at the vine that caught your arm.  But no sooner do you sever it than another one springs up to catch it again.  And then the ones at your legs creep higher, climbing up your body and beneath your clothes, bursting outwards to shred your outfit into tattered scraps.

Revissa begins to panic as she gets targeted as well.  Leafy tendrils snare her legs, pressing them together firmly.  

“Maybe if I… use a Plant Growth spell I can convince them we’re more useful to them active than tied up,” she reasons, working on an incantation for just that.  But even after the nature energy spools outwards from her staff and into the ground beneath you, the vines don’t stop probing.  In fact, they just climb higher, binding Revissa’s arms to her sides and ruining her clothing as well.

Seeing it didn’t help, you redouble your efforts against the vines, but they are ruthlessly persistent, growing tighter and stronger with every passing second.  You only manage to free your arm for a moment before it’s snatched up once again.  And now you’re somehow feeling a strange tingling sensation down towards your legs.

“What… why is it… my legs feel… weak,” you murmur, glancing downwards.  And then your eyes widen in fear as you see a brown, barky texture beginning to spread along your skin.  “Revissa!  It’s… transforming me…”

She notices it on you as well, and a look of regret flashes across her face.

“No… I… my spell only empowered them.  Unlocked… new abilities.  They were just trying to catch us before… but now… they are trying to… to convert us into a part of the forest!”

You give one last tug against the restraints, but your strength is waning.  “Can you… do something else?”

“I… I didn’t want to hurt them… but maybe… a withering spell will — mmphh!”

But her words are cut off as more vines snake around her lips.  Did the plants *know* she was planning on harming them?  You try to call out to give her encouragement, but feel the same tendrils snaking around your mouth as well.  This is bad, really bad.  You don’t have the energy to keep resisting.  And your body is growing more and more numb as the transformation creeps higher.  Up your legs, over your hips, around your breasts, down your arms to the tips of your fingers.  Your limbs lock in place, sensation flees your body, the sound of crackling bark fills your ears as it reaches your neck.

“Mmmpphh…”

You can only make one last plaintive grunt of helplessness towards Revissa, sparing her a pleading glance before wood grain washes over your face and everything goes black.  She only lasts a few minutes longer than you do before she suffers the same fate, converted into a wooden statue that is unable to voice any more opinions on the matter.

Here in this part of the forest, everything is interconnected.  Not quite a single organism, more like a community, a network of individuals who all eagerly share their resources with one another to ensure that everyone can thrive.  

You and Revissa are now a part of that community.  Long ago, your bodies were converted into sculptures made of wood.  The vines have long since unfurled from your inert bodies, which proceeded to topple over onto the dirt with a soft thud the next time a strong gust of wind washed over them.  Neither of you are aware of this, of course - you’re just statues, after all.  But statues that are full of life and potential.  

When the rain washes over you, trace elements of that energy wash off your bodies and filter into the soil.  When animals rest on you, that energy flows into them through their feet, and when moss grows in the little cracks on your wooden bodies, it eventually releases spores that carry through the air to the rest of the forest.  Though neither of you think, feel, or move anymore, you’re still very much alive, still a source of nourishment, still a valued member of the thriving forest ecosystem.

No one ever finds the two of you.  You’ll never know what happened to the rest of your crew, both because they never pass by where the two of you lay, and also because you’re no longer capable of thinking about them.  Just two hunks of wood, as inert as logs floating in the river.  When you tried to leave, the forest said no, decided you were too precious a resource to be allowed to leave.  The forest got its way.  And so, here you both will stay.  

Forever.

Neither of you are aware of this, of course - you’re just statues, after all.  But statues that are full of life and potential.  

Lucky for you that one element of that potential is contained in the Star Scout homing beacon you swallowed at the start of the adventure.  It allowed your crew to track you down and recover your wooden bodies from the ground.  After some effort, Lumina is able to use her healing magic to restore you both back to flesh, and you awaken with a start on a bed back on your ship.  Unfortunately, though they managed to save your lives, the data collection device was destroyed by the elements while you were petrified.  And so you manage to escape being a permanent resident of the forest, though your mission is, sadly, a complete failure.

But that ship had already left days ago, piloted remotely to return to the central camp near the ruins.  

Your crew is here because of a message Ros’eela sent them.  While monitoring the footage from security drones circling the outpost, she happened to spy a pair of wooden statues abandoned in the forest - bearing the familiar likeness of two people she’d met not very long ago.  Anxious about their safety, she sent a message to the Lucky Break - but she used an old comm channel she remembered from years ago to send it, one which your crew had not been monitoring on account of the secrecy of the current mission.  It was only after they had given up on the search for the two of you and were about to take off that they happened to check it and find out the truth.

So now they are here, spreading out to try and find that same security footage so that they can pinpoint where it was you were caught.  Krysta is the first one to find a clue.

“Ah crap.  You’d better come take a look at this,” she says, directing everyone towards one of the large amber hunks that litter the field.

“Oh no!” says Lumina.  “Something must have happened to her after she sent us that message!”

She runs up and places a hand on the chunk of resin, closing her eyes to sense the life energy emanating from it.

“I think… she is okay in there.  All of them are.  But I have no idea how we would get her out.”

Jyumon waves a hand for a quick scrying spell, viewing the scene through the magical spectrum.  “Hrm.  This reminds me of the sacred sap used by the Squira on Del Thora.  I suspect they might have an idea how to undo it.”

“An unfortunate development,” says Vhaja.  “And certainly something to pursue once we leave the planet.  But it does not help us in discerning Melfy’s location.”  She turns to Krysta.  “I see a disabled drone on the floor there.  Do you think you can hack into it and access the security footage?”

“On it!” says the red-head.  The excitement of going on a hunt in the forest causes her latent lycanthropy to manifest, making a bushy squirrel tail poof out from her backside.

In the end, Krysta’s talents prove to be reliable.  It only takes her a few minutes to find the data, and then after cross-referencing it with a topological map of the forest they have a good idea of where you ended up.  Another hour of walking and something comes into view ahead of them.]

By now, the vines that had snared you have receded back into the earth, leaving behind nothing but a pair of wood grain statues, trapped in awkward poses.  You and Revissa, of course, are unable to speak a word, to offer any explanation as to how you ended up in this embarrassing position.

Vhaja sighs.  “I’d have expected as much from Melfy, but I had hoped Revissa would have been able to prevent this from happening.”

“Especially since this is all nature-y stuff,” says Krysta.  “Woulda thought she’d be immune or something.”

Lumina spreads her wings and starts to glide towards the two wooden sculptures.  “I will see if I can restore them,” she says.  

But she never gets that chance.  Because as soon as she starts to approach, a gust of wind blows a cloud of seed spores from some flowering branches off a nearby tree, tripping her up in a fragrant dust storm that brings her down to the ground in a sneezing fit.  The others come up to assist her, getting themselves coated in the same clingy bits of pollen, sticking to their hair, fur, and clothes.

It’s Vhaja who realizes the danger first – but by then, it’s already too late.

But already the seeds are erupting, causing spirals of creeper vines to splay out from within, growing at an impossible rate to encircle your four would-be rescuers in a moment.  Their clothing is shorn from their body as the vines cling to their skin, digging in deep enough to send paralytic toxins into their bloodstreams.

“Crap!  No!  I… c-can’t… move!” yells Krysta.

“N-no!  What is… this!  I… I… my arms… won’t….” Lumina squeals, before it becomes too difficult to speak.

Jyumon mutters the first few syllables of a fire spell to try and burn away the creeping vines, but her body freezes before she can finish the incantation.

“We… we must!  Try… try and… f-fight… it…” Vhaja begins, but her strength gives out from her and she falls to the ground weakly, legs splayed apart in an embarrassing display of helplessness.]

And just like that, they are caught.  No more words escape from their lips, as the powerful toxins get to work.  They do more than arrest your friends’ movement.  They poison them, transform them, convert them into plant matter, just like they did for you and your wife.  With unseeing wooden eyes, you can only stare ahead lifelessly as your crew succumbs to the very same trap that ended your adventure, transforming them all into motionless sculptures of carved wood.

“....”
“....”
“....”
“....”

Bound in vines, robbed of mobility, of sight, of their very consciousness, your beloved friends join you as more mute fixtures of the forest, unable to help you, or anyone else, escape from the fate that was decided for them.]

Eventually the vines recede, their work done, leaving behind six frozen victims, who will now become permanent additions to the scenery.  None of you move an inch, none of you speak a word.  And this time, there’s no one to send a distress call to ask for more help.  Everyone who could possibly have come to your aid is trapped, ensuring you and your crew will be here for a long, long time.

Their branches spread wide, hungrily drinking in the sunlight, eagerly collecting its energy which will filter through their roots into the soil below.  Here in this part of the forest, everything is interconnected.  Not quite a single organism, more like a community, a network of individuals who all eagerly share their resources with one another to ensure that everyone can thrive.  

You, Revissa, and the rest of your friends are now a part of that community.  Long ago, your bodies were converted into sculptures made of wood.  The vines have long since unfurled from your inert bodies, which proceeded to topple over onto the dirt with a soft thud the next time a strong gust of wind washed over them.  None of you are aware of this, of course - you’re just statues, after all.  But statues that are full of life and potential.  

When the rain washes over you, trace elements of that energy wash off your bodies and filter into the soil.  When animals rest on you, that energy flows into them through their feet, and when moss grows in the little cracks on your wooden bodies, it eventually releases spores that carry through the air to the rest of the forest.  Though none of you think, feel, or move anymore, you’re still very much alive, still a source of nourishment, still a valued member of the thriving forest ecosystem.

No one ever finds you.  The Knottie outpost you came from becomes lost to the elements, the amber-encased women left behind by their kin to spend eternity as glistening trophies that send dappled waves of gold onto the ground when the sunlight filters through them.  All Ros’eela’s message accomplished was ensuring that your friends rejoined you in the worst way possible, the six of you now laying inertly on the ground, doing nothing but melding in with nature.  

No intelligent eyes will ever gaze upon you again.  And though the forest knows you are here, it’s in the same way it knows about rocks, and leaves, of twigs and berries and old, forgotten logs.  You’re a part of nature, but not in any way important to it.  Just six hunks of wood, and nothing more.

Though there is still one thing about you that stands out.  A long, long time ago, you swallowed a candy capable of sending out a distress beacon on a Star Scout frequency.  And though it takes many decades, that message does eventually find a receiver.  A passing Scout tracks you down and recovers your inert bodies, brings you onto her ship and brings you to a recovery center, where, eventually, someone will find the time to restore you and your friends to flesh.

But by the time that happens, it will be nearly a hundred years since you first fell into that trap.  The galaxy will be much changed in that time, leading to a whole new set of adventures for your faithful crew.  But that’s a story for another day, and irrelevant to this one, to this mission.  A mission which, of course, has ended in abject failure.

*Explanation:* Early in the game, players have the option to swallow a Star Scout candy.  This is a trigger that determines the exact ending you get when you Game Over.  If Yes, endings are less severe, and the heroines are eventually rescued (though it may take a long time).  If No, endings are more grim and permanent.
